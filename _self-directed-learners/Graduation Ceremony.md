## Graduation Ceremony 2022

Part of the journey is the end.

It was an emotional day for our Class of 2022 as we celebrate the successes and achievements of our graduating cohort during the Graduation Ceremony this morning. There were candid moments and most importantly heartfelt moments of gratitude as we look back at their journey as Regenites.

As they busy themselves in the month ahead with preparing for the National Examinations, we wish them all the best!

Blaze forth to glory!
