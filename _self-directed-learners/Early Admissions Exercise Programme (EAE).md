<p>The Polytechnic Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) allows students to apply
for and receive conditional offers for admission prior to their GCE O-Level
Examinations. Students applying through the Polytechnic EAE are considered
for admission on the basis of demonstrated aptitude and interest, beyond
just
<br>academic grades.</p>
<p>In Regent Secondary, the EAE programme serves as a platform to encapsulate
the schoolâ€™s 4-D (Discover, Decide, Develop, Dream) approach to education
and career guidance. Secondary 4 Express (4E) and Secondary 5 Normal Academic
(5N) students are provided guidance in their EAE application.</p>
<p>In 2023, 49.2% of 4E5N students who applied for Early Admission Exercise
were admitted into polytechnics through the Early Admission Exercise.</p>
