## **Advanced Elective Module (AEM) & Elective Module (EM)**

**Purpose:**

The offering of AEM / EM is to

*   broaden the learning experiences of students
*   complement the secondary school curriculum with a focus on the practical application of knowledge.

**Objectives :**

*   ****Joy of Learning:**** To provide our students with Applied Learning opportunities – learning that involves doing and applying, learning about the real world, and learning for life.
*   ****Aspiration:**** To allow our students to discover their interests and make informed education and career choices through the experience and learning in the polytechnic.
*   Part of the school’s effort to encourage our Secondary 3 students with interest in the different subjects (Science/Math/C&T/POA/Sport Science) to take up ApLMs.

Through the ApLM, we hope that our students will develop a stronger sense of purpose and motivation to acquire knowledge and skills of the subject.
