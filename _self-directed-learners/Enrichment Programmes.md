<h2><strong>Sec 2 Science Busking</strong></h2>
<p>Each year, our students have the opportunity to take part in Science Buskers,
an annual competition organised by A*STAR and Science Centre Singapore.
As a hands-on, interactive way of learning and sharing about Science, Science
Busking sees students applying scientific concepts learnt to real-world
situations and showcasing their ideas through skillful, live demonstrations
using everyday objects. It is here that Science comes alive for our students,
who experience first-hand just how powerful the subject is in undergirding
all aspects of life!</p>
