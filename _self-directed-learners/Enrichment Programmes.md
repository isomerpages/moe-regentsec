<h2><strong>Sec 2 Science Busking</strong></h2>
<p>Each year, our students have the opportunity to take part in Science Buskers,
an annual competition organised by A*STAR and Science Centre Singapore.
As a hands-on, interactive way of learning and sharing about Science, Science
Busking sees students applying scientific concepts learnt to real-world
situations and showcasing their ideas through skillful, live demonstrations
using everyday objects. It is here that Science comes alive for our students,
who experience first-hand just how powerful the subject is in undergirding
all aspects of life!</p>

<h2><strong>Conversational Chinese and Malay Language (CCM) Programme</strong></h2>
<p>Conversational Chinese and Malay Language (CCM) Programme &nbsp;aims to
strengthen Singapore’s multiracial identity and expose students to a third
language. &nbsp;Students will have an elementary understanding of a different
mother tongue language and have the opportunity to explore cultural aspects
of a particular ethnic group. Being able to communicate with others in
a different mother tongue language will enable students to expand their
cultural consciousness beyond their individual ethnic groups. &nbsp;At
the end of the programme, students will be equipped with basic conversational
skills to enable them to interact with native speakers confidently.</p>
