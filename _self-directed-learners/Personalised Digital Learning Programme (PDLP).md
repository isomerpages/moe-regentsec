<h2><strong>Enriching School Experience – Developing Digital Learners</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Gathering Information and Digital Preparation in Art</strong></h3>
<p>The Personal Learning Device (PLD) has been invaluable in Art lessons
here at Regent Secondary School. In a unit on Printmaking, for example,
our Secondary One students used their PLDs to access a lesson package on
the Student Learning Space (SLS) that deepened their understanding of the
metaphorical significance of objects as placeholders of experience and
memories. Question prompts in the lesson package guided students in reflecting
on their own childhood memories and composing still-life arrangements of
objects that evoked these memories for them. Having prepared the still-life
photos beforehand in this Flipped Classroom approach helped make the transition
to actual printmaking a seamless one, and students enjoyed more time for
hands-on art making in the classroom.</p>

<h3><strong>Active Student Participation in Principles of Accounts and Mathematics</strong></h3>
<p>Classpoint and Google Suite are some of the ICT tools that are incorporated
in our Principles of Accounts lessons to better engage students and monitor
their learning. The real-time feedback that students receive through these
online check-in quizzes allows students to assess their own learning gaps
in a timely and personalised manner. In particular, the Google Forms to
create Escape Rooms—an enjoyable mode of hands-on assessment for students
to apply what they have learnt. Likewise, in Mathematics, our Secondary
Three students learnt to measure the diameter of a chord through an exciting
inquiry-based project. They used their PLDs to watch an explanatory video
on the concept online and worked in groups to apply their learning using
GeoGebra and other hands-on materials. Students also learn to use flowcharts
as an effective way to visualize and apply computational thinking concepts,
helping students understand the steps involved in solving mathematical
problems.</p>

<h3><strong>Collaborative Writing in English Language</strong></h3>
<p>Google Workspace features prominently in Regent Secondary School’s English
Language curriculum. For example, in a unit on Situational Writing, students
worked in teams to develop and organise their ideas for the essay, using
the search engine to gather information about the various topics assigned.
Googling for primary sources such as images and videos on their own helped
make the research process more tangible for students, and they were able
to craft rich sensory descriptions to enliven their writing. Through the
activity, students became more confident and adept users of the PLD, employing
tools such as Google Docs and Google Sheets to jot down and share their
ideas with their teachers and peers.</p>
<h3><strong>Collaborating on Research using Google Slides in Science</strong></h3>
<p>Researching and building a prototype in Science often requires much collaboration
and our young scientists at Regent Secondary School have learnt to do just
that with Google Slides on their PLDs. In a recent unit on water filtration
methods, our Secondary One students used Google Slides to outline group
roles and brainstorm ideas. They also learnt how to use online bookmarking
tools to gather information for building their water filters. The project
culminated in an enriching sharing session using the digital posters they
created with Google Slides to synthesise their learning.</p>

<h3><strong>Learning and Perfecting Technique in Physical Education</strong></h3>
<p>The use of a Blended Learning approach in PE lessons enables students
build conceptual understanding of game concepts in sports. To learn more
about how the Drop Shot and Smash are used to create and attack space in
Badminton, our Secondary Two students worked on bite-sized theory lessons
on SLS that they then learnt to apply during hands-on sessions in PE. This
helped to bridge the theory-practice gap and allowed for more face-to-face
instructional time to be spent on honing students’ skills and confidence
in the sport.</p>

<h3><strong>Student Quotes</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I enjoy using the Chromebook as it is better than writing with pen &amp;
paper. The lessons are interesting because we get to do our own research
using our devices. It is such a dream to be able use our devices in class!
- (Chester, 1-Pride)</p>
<p>Having inquiry-based lessons with our Chromebooks in class is interesting.
I think that with these lessons, we are able to better understand how the
concepts learnt are used in real life and this helps us to better appreciate
the lesson material. - (Weng Hin, 3-Empathy)</p>

<h2><strong>Personal Learning Devices (PLD) Distribution</strong></h2>
<p>The MOE National Literacy Programme aims to equip all students with the
necessary skills and competencies to thrive in the digital age.</p>
<p>Regent’s PDLP Vision for Students are to develop them into:</p>
<p>1. Self-directed learners who <strong>Manage and monitor their own learning with confidence</strong>
</p>
<p>2. Critical thinkers who <strong>Navigate for information with discernment</strong>
</p>
<p>3. Collaborative learners who <strong>Connect with peers to co-construct knowledge</strong>
</p>
<p>On 26 March 2024, all Secondary 1 students receive their ACER Chromebooks.
With the students on-boarding programme completed, both students and teachers
will enhance teaching and learning with the use of personal devices for
more active, collaborative lessons based on sound e-pedagogical principles.</p>
