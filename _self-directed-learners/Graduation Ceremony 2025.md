<p>The Class of 2025 stepped into a new chapter of their journey at Regent
Secondary with our Graduation Assembly, themed “A New Chapter Begins.”
As the graduands entered the hall, cheers and applause from teachers and
peers filled the air, setting a joyful and proud tone for the celebration.
Smiles, laughter, and excitement were everywhere as the students marked
the culmination of their Secondary School journey.</p>
<p>The assembly kicked off with an inspiring address by Upper Secondary Year
Head, Mdm Annie Teo, who encouraged students to embrace challenges with
courage and resilience. Graduands were reminded to reflect on the growth,
friendships, and memories they had made, while stepping confidently into
the adventures that lie ahead.</p>
<p>The highlight of the assembly was the segment featuring chairpersons and
vice-chairpersons from each class, who expressed their gratitude to their
teachers and peers for guidance and support over the years. Each class
then received their graduation scrolls, a symbol of their achievements
and milestones. Special class montages brought back treasured memories—from
fun moments in lessons and school activities to laughter-filled outings
and celebrations—allowing students to relive the journey they had shared
together and cherish the bonds they had formed.</p>
<p>The assembly ended on a high note with the singing of the school song,
a moving finale that echoed the pride, camaraderie, and spirit of Regent.
Students and teachers then continued the celebrations at a tea reception
and photobooth in the canteen, capturing joyful memories of this special
day.</p>
<p>The Class of 2025 leaves Regent Secondary with hearts full of gratitude,
resilience, and pride—ready to write their next chapter with confidence,
enthusiasm, and purpose.</p>
