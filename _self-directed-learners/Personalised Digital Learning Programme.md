### **Enriching School Experience – Developing Digital Learners**
-------------------------------------------------------------

##### **Gathering Information and Digital Preparation in Art**

The Personal Learning Device (PLD) has been invaluable in Art lessons here at Regent Secondary School. In a unit on Printmaking, for example, our Secondary One students used their PLDs to access a lesson package on the Student Learning Space (SLS) that deepened their understanding of the metaphorical significance of objects as placeholders of experience and memories. Question prompts in the lesson package guided students in reflecting on their own childhood memories and composing still-life arrangements of objects that evoked these memories for them. Having prepared the still-life photos beforehand in this Flipped Classroom approach helped make the transition to actual printmaking a seamless one, and students enjoyed more time for hands-on art making in the classroom.

##### **Active Student Participation in Principles of Accounts and Mathematics**

Classkick and Nearpod are some of the tools that are regularly used in our Principles of Accounts lessons to better engage students and monitor their learning. The real-time feedback that students receive through these online check-in quizzes allows students to assess their own learning gaps in a timely and personalised manner. Our teachers have also used Google Forms to create Escape Rooms—an enjoyable mode of hands-on assessment for students to apply what they have learnt. Likewise, in Mathematics, our Secondary Three students learnt to measure the diameter of a chord through an exciting inquiry-based project. They used their PLDs to watch an explanatory video on the concept online and worked in groups to apply their learning using GeoGebra and other hands-on materials.

##### **Collaborative Writing in English Language**

Google Workspace features prominently in Regent Secondary School’s English Language curriculum. For example, in a unit on Situational Writing, students worked in teams to develop and organise their ideas for the essay, using the search engine to gather information about the various topics assigned. Googling for primary sources such as images and videos on their own helped make the research process more tangible for students, and they were able to craft rich sensory descriptions to enliven their writing. Through the activity, students became more confident and adept users of the PLD, employing tools such as Google Docs and Google Sheets to jot down and share their ideas with their teachers and peers.

##### **Google Sites and Inquiry Learning in the Humanities**

Inquiry Learning is a core component of our History, Geography, and Social Studies lessons, and the PLD has been a useful tool for aiding students in their research and curation of materials. In a recent Geographical Investigation project on Pang Sua Canal, our Secondary One students worked together to design a Google Site to present their findings on human activities around the Canal and their implications on water quality. Similarly, for a Social Studies Inquiry Investigation project, our Secondary Three students learnt to showcase their learning by embedding website links, documents, and videos in their Google Sites for a more interactive user experience.

##### **Collaborating on Research using Google Slides in Science**

Researching and building a prototype in Science often requires much collaboration and our young scientists at Regent Secondary School have learnt to do just that with Google Slides on their PLDs. In a recent unit on water filtration methods, our Secondary One students used Google Slides to outline group roles and brainstorm ideas. They also learnt how to use online bookmarking tools to gather information for building their water filters. The project culminated in an enriching sharing session using the digital posters they created with Google Slides to synthesise their learning.
