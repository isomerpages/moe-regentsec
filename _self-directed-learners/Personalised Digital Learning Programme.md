### **Enriching School Experience – Developing Digital Learners**
-------------------------------------------------------------

##### **Gathering Information and Digital Preparation in Art**

The Personal Learning Device (PLD) has been invaluable in Art lessons here at Regent Secondary School. In a unit on Printmaking, for example, our Secondary One students used their PLDs to access a lesson package on the Student Learning Space (SLS) that deepened their understanding of the metaphorical significance of objects as placeholders of experience and memories. Question prompts in the lesson package guided students in reflecting on their own childhood memories and composing still-life arrangements of objects that evoked these memories for them. Having prepared the still-life photos beforehand in this Flipped Classroom approach helped make the transition to actual printmaking a seamless one, and students enjoyed more time for hands-on art making in the classroom.

##### **Active Student Participation in Principles of Accounts and Mathematics**

Classkick and Nearpod are some of the tools that are regularly used in our Principles of Accounts lessons to better engage students and monitor their learning. The real-time feedback that students receive through these online check-in quizzes allows students to assess their own learning gaps in a timely and personalised manner. Our teachers have also used Google Forms to create Escape Rooms—an enjoyable mode of hands-on assessment for students to apply what they have learnt. Likewise, in Mathematics, our Secondary Three students learnt to measure the diameter of a chord through an exciting inquiry-based project. They used their PLDs to watch an explanatory video on the concept online and worked in groups to apply their learning using GeoGebra and other hands-on materials.
