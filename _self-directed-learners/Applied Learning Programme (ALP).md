In a world where technology has become pervasive in our daily lives, it is critical for students to be equipped with skills that will enable them to thrive in our Smart Nation. At Regent Secondary School, we prepare our students to be future-ready through our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) on Emerging Technologies.

Regent’s ALP seeks to imbue in students a deeper appreciation of developments in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) through an array of hands-on activities. Our exciting curriculum will provide students with the opportunity to:

*   Conceptualise, construct, and programme their own Remote-Controlled vehicles using micro:bit, a block programming tool

*   Design Smart Home device applications and sensors using cloud computing software like the M5GO Internet of Things (IoT) kit

*   Collaborate with their peers on projects that showcase how technology may be used for good in solving real-world problems

*   Learn more about STEM industries through Learning Journeys, Elective Modules and Advanced Elective Modules

Overall, Regent’s ALP will develop students’ critical thinking, problem-solving, and inquiry skills, which will stand them in good stead for life and learning in our digital age.
