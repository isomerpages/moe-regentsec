<h2><strong>Developing GREEN Advocates</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong></h3>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) helps students connect academic knowledge
and skills with the real world. ALP is intended to help students appreciate
the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic arena
and to develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and
skills. ALP is non-examinable and its emphasis is on the application of
knowledge and thinking skills, stretching the imagination and applying
these to authentic settings in society and industries.</p>
<h3><strong>ALP – Resource Sustainability (from 2024)</strong></h3>
<p>Increasing effects of climate change, urbanisation and resources depletions
call for an urgency for all of us and especially for our country which
is without any natural resources to ensure a sustainable and climate resilient
Singapore. In addition, in line with SG 2030 Green Plan, it is important
that our students are developed as GREEN (Growing Responsible Ecology and
ENvironment) Advocates and changemakers in resource sustainability.</p>
<h4><u>TIER 1</u></h4>
<p><strong>(A) Learning about the Real World through Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will learn about the global challenges associated with resource
scarcity and responsible consumption and management of food and water resources
through the various subject syllabi in Geography, Science and Nutrition
&amp; Food Science.</p>
<p>Students will also be engaged in group projects and meaningful conversations
through participating in Inter-disciplinary Learning Journeys, e.g. to
Marina Barrage, Science Centre, Smart Nation CityScape, etc., to gain deeper
and broadened understanding of ‘Go Green SG’ and Singapore’s efforts towards
water sustainability</p>
<p><strong>(B) Learning by Doing and Applying through Culture, Community and within Campus</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will be able to apply what they have learnt through the Student-Initiated
Learning project (during HBL) to promote sustainability efforts, Cohort-wide
VIA which involves school collaborations with various community partners
and CCA-based projects such as Edible Garden, Indoor Spice Garden, etc.
These platforms and opportunities enable students to showcase applications
of learning, advocate behaviour or explore new solutions to reduce environmental
sustainability issues.</p>
<p><strong>(C) Learning for Life and Advocating for causes in Community</strong>
</p>
<p>Partnership and linkages with various community sectors and relevant industries
will allow students to experience and connect with the world beyond the
school.</p>
<h4><u>TIER 2</u></h4>
<p><strong>(D) Environment Champions and Eco-Stewardship</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will be given opportunities to attend and participate in external
forums organised by North West CDC, Nature Society, etc. With their beyond
the school exposure and enhanced Awareness, they will also take lead to
Amplify conservation efforts for the four environmental commemorative days,
i.e. Earth Day, Water Day, Environment Day and ASEAN Dengue Day. There
could also be overseas trips for students to deepen their acquisition of
21CC and for authentic learning of how countries in Southeast Asia embrace
green technology and adopt clean energy.</p>
