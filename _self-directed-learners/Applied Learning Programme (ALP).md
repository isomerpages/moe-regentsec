<h2><strong>Developing GREEN Advocates</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP)</strong></h3>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) helps students connect academic knowledge
and skills with the real world. ALP is intended to help students appreciate
the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic arena
and to develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and
skills. ALP is non-examinable and its emphasis is on the application of
knowledge and thinking skills, stretching the imagination and applying
these to authentic settings in society and industries.</p>

<h3><strong>ALP – Resource Sustainability (from 2024)</strong></h3>
<p>Increasing effects of climate change, urbanisation and resources depletions
call for an urgency for all of us and especially for our country which
is without any natural resources to ensure a sustainable and climate resilient
Singapore. In addition, in line with SG 2030 Green Plan, it is important
that our students are developed as GREEN (Growing Responsible Ecology and
ENvironment) Advocates and changemakers in resource sustainability.</p>
<h4><u>TIER 1</u></h4>
<p><strong>(A) Learning about the Real World through Curriculum</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will learn about the global challenges associated with resource
scarcity and responsible consumption and management of food and water resources
through the various subject syllabi in English, Geography, Science, Mathematics
and Nutrition &amp; Food Science.</p>
<p>Students will also be engaged in group projects and meaningful conversations
through participating in Inter-disciplinary Learning Journeys, e.g. to
Marina Barrage, Gardens by the Bay, etc., to gain deeper and broadened
understanding of ‘Go Green SG’ and Singapore’s efforts towards water and
energy sustainability.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>(B) Learning by Doing and Applying through Culture, Community and within Campus</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will be able to apply what they have learnt through the Student-Initiated
Learning project (during HBL) to promote sustainability efforts, Cohort-wide
VIA which involves school collaborations with various community partners
and CCA-based projects such as Let's be G.R.E.EN, etc. These platforms
and opportunities enable students to showcase applications of learning,
advocate behaviour or explore new solutions to reduce environmental sustainability
issues.</p>
<p><strong>(C) Learning for Life and Advocating for causes in Community</strong>
</p>
<p>Partnership and linkages with various community sectors and relevant industries
will allow students to experience and connect with the world beyond the
school.</p>
<h4><u>TIER 2</u></h4>
<p><strong>(D) Environment Champions and Eco-Stewardship</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will be given opportunities to attend and participate in external
forums and competitions. With their beyond the school exposure and enhanced
Awareness, they will also take lead to Amplify conservation efforts during
Let's R.O.W!, Let's R.A.C.E! and Let's be G.R.E.EN!</p>
