<h2><strong>Student Sign-Up Learning (SSUL)</strong></h2>
<p>In Regent, one of the ways students demonstrate self-directedness is by
taking pride in their learning and actively approaching their teachers
for consultation sessions to clarify their doubts through the Student Sign-Up
Learning (SSUL) approach. Students will take the initiative to ask questions
and monitor their progress in learning.</p>
