<h2><strong>Student Sign-Up Learning (SSUL)</strong></h2>
<p>In Regent, one of the ways students demonstrate self-directedness is by
taking pride in their learning and actively approaching their teachers
for consultation sessions to clarify their doubts through the Student Sign-Up
Learning (SSUL) approach. Students will take the initiative to ask questions
and monitor their progress in learning.</p>

<h2><strong>Enhancing Student Learning Experiences</strong></h2>
<p>Use of learner centred pedagogy creates opportunities for teachers to
enhance our student learning experiences.</p>

<p>During English Language lessons, students use VR goggles to immerse themselves
in exciting scenarios. They practice Oracy skills by narrating their virtual
experiences of extreme sports like skydiving or surfing and improve writing
by exploring virtual heritage tours to landmarks like the Eiffel Tower
to craft their descriptive essays. This immersive approach makes learning
engaging and practical.</p>
<h3>Maths Classroom</h3>

<h3>Humanities Classroom</h3>
<p>Our Humanities academic programmes in History, Social Studies, and Geography
is dedicated to cultivating critical thinking by encouraging students to
explore multiple perspectives through inquiry-based learning. We engage
students in dynamic projects, learning journeys, thought-provoking discussions,
and debates that challenge them to analyze and reflect deeply on historical
events, societal issues, and geographical concepts. Through role-plays,
presentations, and the integration of ICT tools, our students experience
a vibrant learning environment that enhances their skills and prepares
them for the complexities of a globalized world.</p>

<p>The intent is for students to experience the joy of conducting scientific
inquiry through the thematic approach, generate ideas and solutions in
contexts related to Science-Technology-Society and Environment and to participate
in non-routine learning experiences on core ideas and practices of Science.</p>
