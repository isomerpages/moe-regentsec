<p>In Regent, one of the ways students demonstrate self-directedness is by
taking pride in their learning and actively approaching their teachers
for consultation sessions to clarify their doubts through the Student Sign-Up
Learning (SSUL) approach. Students will take the initiative to ask questions
and monitor their progress in learning.</p>

<h2><strong>Enhancing Student Learning Experiences</strong></h2>
<p>Use of learner centred pedagogy creates opportunities for teachers to
enhance our student learning experiences.</p>
<h3>English Language Classroom</h3>

<p>During English Language lessons, students use VR goggles to immerse themselves
in exciting scenarios. They practice Oracy skills by narrating their virtual
experiences of extreme sports like skydiving or surfing and improve writing
by exploring virtual heritage tours to landmarks like the Eiffel Tower
to craft their descriptive essays. This immersive approach makes learning
engaging and practical.</p>
<h3>Maths Classroom</h3>

<h4>Application of Trigonometric Ratios in Real-World Context</h4>
<p>Students apply trigonometric ratios to solve problems situated in authentic
real-world contexts, such as determining the height of a structure, calculating
the distance between two points, or finding angles of elevation and depression.
Through these applications, students develop an appreciation of how trigonometry
is used in fields such as engineering, architecture, and navigation.</p>
<p>An <strong>online Assessment for Learning (AFL) tool</strong> is utilised
to evaluate students’ understanding of trigonometric concepts. The quiz
provides immediate feedback, enabling students to identify misconceptions,
consolidate their learning, and demonstrate mastery of key skills in a
self-directed manner.</p>
<h3>Humanities Classroom</h3>
<p>Our Humanities academic programmes in History, Social Studies, and Geography
is dedicated to cultivating critical thinking by encouraging students to
explore multiple perspectives through inquiry-based learning. We engage
students in dynamic projects, learning journeys, thought-provoking discussions,
and debates that challenge them to analyze and reflect deeply on historical
events, societal issues, and geographical concepts. Through role-plays,
presentations, and the integration of ICT tools, our students experience
a vibrant learning environment that enhances their skills and prepares
them for the complexities of a globalized world.</p>

<h3>Lower Sec Science Classroom</h3>
<p>Integrative Activities are infused into the curriculum as a culminating
or capstone activity for a theme taught in the Lower Secondary Science
Curriculum.</p>

<p>The intent is for students to experience the joy of conducting scientific
inquiry through the thematic approach, generate ideas and solutions in
contexts related to Science-Technology-Society and Environment and to participate
in non-routine learning experiences on core ideas and practices of Science.</p>
