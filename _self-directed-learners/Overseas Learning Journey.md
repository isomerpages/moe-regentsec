<h4><strong>Visit by Delegates from the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China</strong></h4>
<p>On 22 July 2022, Regent Secondary School played host to a special group
of delegates: Education Counselor Mr Kang Kai, Minister Counselor Mr Zhou
Yu Yun, Second Secretary Mr Qiao Dan, and Mr Li Dian, Attache from the
Embassy of the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>After a warm welcome by our Principal, HOD/MTL Mr Phang Yuh Koon shared
more about our school’s implementation of the Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) syllabus with the delegates. To gain more insight into
how CCE has impacted Regenites, our visitors engaged in a dialogue session
with 25 Secondary Three students who were proud to share their school experiences.
There was also a lively Q&amp;A session on issues pertaining to CCE with
our school’s Key Personnel.</p>
<p>At the end of the dialogue session, Mr Kang Kai was presented with a painting
of our school to commemorate this very special day.</p>
<p>As CCA is an integral part of students’ holistic development and where
many teachable moments in CCE may be gleaned, the delegates also embarked
on a school tour which featured our vibrant Uniformed Group, Sports, and
Performing Arts CCAs.</p>
<p>It was a truly fruitful visit, and we look forward to more enriching collaborations
with the Chinese Embassy as well as immersion programmes with our twinning
school in China!</p>
