<p>A select group of Secondary 3 students had an exciting chance to visit
Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam month. &nbsp;During the 4 days 3 nights trip,
there were many learning opportunities offered as they explored the old
city via a City Tour. Among some of the places that sparked interest were
the Reunification Palace, History Museum of Ho Chi Minh City, War Remnants
Museum and The Central Post Office where students basked in the rich cultural
heritage of the city and learnt more about their unique history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the highlight of the day was the visit to the Agriculture Village
where students participated in a farm-to-table dining experience where
they prepared their own lunch, something new for all of them. The group
also made time to visit and interact with children from the Masion Chance
Orphanage and Nguyen Gia Thieu Secondary School. There, students not only
exchanged performances to learn more about oneanother’s culture, but also
spent time taking part in group activities together, including teaching
common conversational English Language phrases to the children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a meaningful and engaging overseas trip and an opportunity for
our students to develop cross-cultural skills through interaction with
local students.</p>

<h2><strong>Secondary 2 Cultural Immersion Programme to Johore and Malacca</strong></h2>
<p>The month of May was awaited with much anticipation and excitement by
our Secondary Two students. For most of the cohort, it marked the first
ever cross-border trip they would have with their teachers and classmates.
The 2 Days and 1 Night cultural immersion trip to Johore and Malacca, provided
the students with plenty of opportunities to learn about the historical
background as well as cultural and agricultural practices of Johore and
Malacca. During the trip, the students were given the chance to have close
interactions with students from a partner school where they participated
in cultural activities. This allowed students from both sides to understand
and appreciate the cultural differences and diversity between Singapore
and the Malaysian school curriculum and programmes.</p>
<p>During the trip, our students also visited a Johore farm (UK Farm) to
understand modern agricultural practices and better appreciate how our
food products are produced in the farm. In Malacca, students visited key
cultural sites such as A’Famosa, Dutch Square as well as a Baba and Nonya
museum to understand the historical and cultural evolution of Malacca,
making their Secondary One History lessons come alive. It was definitely
an unforgettable experience for our Secondary Two students.</p>

<h2><strong>Overseas Cultural Immersion Trip to Surabaya</strong></h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>A fun fact that not many visitors know about Surabaya is that its moniker
is “city of heroes”. And this was indeed proven true when our Secondary
3 and 4 Regenites enjoyed a hero’s welcome and friendly hospitality during
their visit to Indonesia’s second largest metropolis. This has definitely
made our 4-day 3-night learning journey a memorable experience for our
students which will be remembered fondly for years to come.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Overseas Learning Journey/OLJ 2024/OLJ2024_Surabaya_2.jpg">
</div>
<p>During the trip, our 15 students and 4 teachers were immersed in a cultural
kaleidoscope. Through the visit to historical landmarks such as the Majapahit
Hotel and Heroes Monument, the group was able to take a step back into
history to understand Indonesia’s struggle for independence against the
Dutch. The visit to the Cheng Ho Mosque, the Blue Mosque and Hong Tiek
Hian Temple allowed our students to have a better understanding of the
rich cultural and religious tapestry that made up Surabaya and Indonesia’s
multicultural heritage.</p>
<p>The warmth of the city was only exceeded by the rapturous welcome from
our partner schools, SMPN 4 Surabaya and SMPK St Vincentius. Both schools
provided memorable insights into the Indonesian and East Javan cultures
and ways of life. During the visit to SMPN 4 Surabaya, our students were
meaningfully engaged in a series of cultural activities such as Karawitan,
Remo Traditional Dance, traditional games and Batik Painting and had the
opportunity of learning the Angklung during their visit to SMPK St Vincentius.</p>
<p></p>
<p>They also visited an orphanage and an Old Folks’ Home where students applied
what they had learnt in their Community Youth Leadership Programme to plan
a series of interaction activities to reach out to the elderly and the
children in Surabaya to be a positive influence and agent of change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through the varied activities during the trip, our students immersed themselves
and gained a deeper understanding and appreciation for the Indonesian culture.
Most importantly, they learnt what it means to be a student agent and changemaker
through their active planning for and participation in the trip.</p>

<h4><strong>Visit by Delegates from the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China</strong></h4>
<p>On 22 July 2022, Regent Secondary School played host to a special group
of delegates: Education Counselor Mr Kang Kai, Minister Counselor Mr Zhou
Yu Yun, Second Secretary Mr Qiao Dan, and Mr Li Dian, Attache from the
Embassy of the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>After a warm welcome by our Principal, HOD/MTL Mr Phang Yuh Koon shared
more about our school’s implementation of the Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) syllabus with the delegates. To gain more insight into
how CCE has impacted Regenites, our visitors engaged in a dialogue session
with 25 Secondary Three students who were proud to share their school experiences.
There was also a lively Q&amp;A session on issues pertaining to CCE with
our school’s Key Personnel.</p>
<p>At the end of the dialogue session, Mr Kang Kai was presented with a painting
of our school to commemorate this very special day.</p>
<p>As CCA is an integral part of students’ holistic development and where
many teachable moments in CCE may be gleaned, the delegates also embarked
on a school tour which featured our vibrant Uniformed Group, Sports, and
Performing Arts CCAs.</p>
<p>It was a truly fruitful visit, and we look forward to more enriching collaborations
with the Chinese Embassy as well as immersion programmes with our twinning
