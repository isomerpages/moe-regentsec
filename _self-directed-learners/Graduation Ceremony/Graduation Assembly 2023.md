<p>On 22 September, Regent Secondary School organised a special Graduation Assembly conducted in the school premise for our graduating cohort. This cohort definitely has come a long way, and gone through various milestones. From the start of Covid-19 Pandemic (wearing of masks, Full HBL, keeping a distance from one another, etc.) to adapting to the New Normal and venturing beyond class-based activities, every experience that the graduating cohort has encountered presents an opportunity for learning and growth, shaping them into who they will become.</p><p>The afternoon was filled with joy, laughter and a sense of nostalgia as we walked down memory lane to revisit some of the key highlights of their school life.</p><p>We hope our seniors had a wonderful time during the celebrations and best wishes to all of them in the upcoming National Examinations.</p><p>Blaze Forth to Glory, Regenites!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Graduation%20Ceremony/GraduationAssembly2023-1.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Graduation%20Ceremony/GraduationAssembly2023-2.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Graduation%20Ceremony/GraduationAssembly2023-3.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Graduation%20Ceremony/GraduationAssembly2023-4.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Graduation%20Ceremony/GraduationAssembly2023-5.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Graduation%20Ceremony/GraduationAssembly2023-6.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Graduation%20Ceremony/GraduationAssembly2023-7.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Graduation%20Ceremony/GraduationAssembly2023-8.png"></div><p></p>
