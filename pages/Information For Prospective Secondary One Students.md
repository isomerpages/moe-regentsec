| Area | Synopsis | Details/Links |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Our Signature Programme: Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**     | Increasing effects of climate change, urbanisation and resources depletions call for an urgency for all of us and especially for our country which is without any natural resources to ensure a sustainable and climate resilient Singapore. Therefore, it is important that our students are developed as GREEN (Growing Responsible Ecology and ENvironment) Advocates and changemakers in resource sustainability.     | Click or scan the QR code below to see the highlights of our ALP Programme, or visit the ALP Webpage for more details!<br><img src="/images/DSA/ALP%20Webpage_QRcode.png"><br>[ALP Website](https://www.regentsec.moe.edu.sg/self-directed-learners/alp/)     |
| **Our Signature Programme: Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**  | Youths are the future leaders and changemakers of society. Guided by the school’s mission of nurturing Transformational Leaders, the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Community Youth Leadership (CYL) provides authentic learning experiences to nurture student agents who are able to contribute back to society based on their own interests and passions.     | Click or scan the QR code below to see the highlights of our LLP programme, or visit the LLP Webpage for more details!<br>![](/images/DSA/LLP%20Webpage_QRcode.png)<br>[LLP Webpage](https://www.regentsec.moe.edu.sg/transformational-leaders/learning-for-life-programme/community-youth-leadership/)  |
