| **Our Signature Programme: Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**  | Increasing effects of climate change, urbanisation and resources depletions call for an urgency for all of us and especially for our country which is without any natural resources to ensure a sustainable and climate resilient Singapore. Therefore, it is important that our students are developed as GREEN (Growing Responsible Ecology and ENvironment) Advocates and changemakers in resource sustainability.     | Click or scan the QR code below to see the highlights of our ALP Programme, or visit the ALP Webpage for more details!<br>![](/images/DSA/ALP%20Webpage_QRcode.png)<br>[ALP Website](https://www.regentsec.moe.edu.sg/self-directed-learners/alp/)   |
