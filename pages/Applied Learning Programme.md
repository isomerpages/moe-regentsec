## **SMART Nation Builder Truck Visit**

The truck is here!
 
The Smart Nation Builder, a roving truck which showcases Singapore's digitalisation initiatives, visited Regent Secondary School on 24 and 25 May 2022. Our students were excited to be a part of this experience and eagerly climbed aboard the truck to try their hand at the various interactive exhibits on display. There were game stations for participants to learn more about Singapore's tech initiatives—such as the LifeSG app—and even a delightful claw machine!
 
The visit certainly helped enhance our students' understanding of Singapore's fast-evolving technological landscape and how tech may be used to better engage citizens.

## **Learning Journey to Headrock VR at Sentosa**

12 April 2022 was an exciting day for our Robotics and Infocom Media Club who went on a DISCOVER Learning Journey organized by IMDA to visit the Headrock VR at Sentosa!

It was an eye-opener for our tech-savvy students to learn the history of the first VT hardware ever invented and the rapid growth in technology of the VR industry in the last 20 years. On top of that, it was a great opportunity for them to witness how Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality and Green Screen Technology are incorporated in our daily lives from gaming, to movies and even to medicine industries.

The icing on the cake – the lucky students experienced first-hand the many VR activities available there. Storm Blizzard, Jungle Rafting, JumpBeat Saber, Skysrapper and Zombie Busters were definitely crowd favourites!

## **ALP Smart Home**

In line with Singapore’s direction of a digital society, Regent Secondary School strongly believes that it is essential to expose students to the concept of a SMART nation through a SMART home.

Our students can experience a SMART home right here in Regent Secondary School. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) committee has successfully incorporated digital infrastructure that would pave the way for intelligent home systems.

Here are some of the devices Regenites can explore in our SMART home: A voice activation smart home hub (Alexa) to control various appliances and items in an ordinary home such as the Roomba, an electric standing fan, curtain blinds, the colour of the lights in the SMART home and a doorbell system that enables homeowners to view and speak to visitors.
