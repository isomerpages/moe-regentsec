## **Total Defence Day 2023**

We commemorated Total Defence Day this year with a slew of activities aimed at rallying Regenites together in responding to challenges that may threaten Singapore’s stability.

The week began with an informative presentation by our Peer Support Leaders, who shared with their classmates practical tips on strengthening social cohesion. Then, on 15 February, our Uniformed Group cadets came together to put up a fine display of unity with a Total Defence Day Parade. They also helmed a special programme to promote awareness of the pillars of Total Defence amongst their peers, with engaging presentations on basic first aid skills and the Public Warning System. To educate Regenites on being secure, alert, and responsible online, our Cyberwellness Ambassadors put up an array of interesting exhibits at the canteen and were on hand to explain what a strong Digital Defence means.

As we have seen over the course of the pandemic, it is important that Singapore remains strong and its populace resilient to withstand challenges both local and global. The week’s CCE lesson highlighted initiatives pertaining to food sustainability in Singapore, and it was inspiring to see Total Defence in action for something so prosaic and which many arguably take for granted.

To round off the week, a lockdown drill was conducted to strengthen our school’s emergency preparedness and response. This served as an important reminder of the part we all have to play in keeping the Regent community and our loved ones safe.
