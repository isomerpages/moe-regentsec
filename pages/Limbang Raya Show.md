On the 21st May 2022, Choa Chu Kang residents attended the Limbang Raya Show, organised by the Limbang Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC), held in our school hall. The event, graced by the Grassroots Adviser, Mr Lawrence Wong, saw guests streaming into the hall donning their best Hari Raya outfits.

Members of the audience were serenaded by live singing performances by members of the MAEC as well as local talents Sufie Rashid, Rozaimi and our very own Secondary 5 student Sarah Syazlina, who belted out songs such _Suasana Hari Raya_ by Sharifah Ainiand _Hari Raya_ by Najwa Latif.

The event was especially memorable for our Secondary Three students, who in their newly-formed group, Putera Armada, performed their very first _dikir barat_ performance item on stage! Decked in _baju Melayu, kain samping_ (cloth wrapped around the waist) and _tanjak_ (traditional headgear), the students, trained by Regent’s Operations Support Officer, Mr Abdul Rahman, sang and clapped to the beat of the gong and percussion instruments. Despite coming from different classes and having few training sessions, the performance was made possible due our students’ passion for Malay arts and culture.

On top of that, prizes that were given out to winners of stage games, lucky draws, house decoration contest and best dressed individuals enlivened the atmosphere. The delectable buffet spread and goodie bags that awaited after the performance made it an event not to be missed as we celebrated the joyous occasion. Although the month-long Hari Raya celebration was drawing to a close, the festive spirit among guests was very much still ablaze!

Thank you.
