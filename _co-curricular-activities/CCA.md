# **CCA**

The CCA Programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents to allow an individual to have a life-long love for a particular activity. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood. It is one of the key Student Development Experiences that contribute towards the holistic development of our students. 

Each CCA has its specific objectives. For instance, Physical Sports (PS) develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in pupils. The Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) instil in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society. Uniformed Group (UG) activities aim to make good citizens of students by inculcating in them self-reliance, resilience, discipline and a spirit of service to others. Clubs and Societies (CS) allow students to explore and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based. Students are honed in information, communication and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery of the specialised areas. Students progressively develop CCA-specific knowledge, skills, values and attitudes through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups. CCA also offer excellent platforms for students to learn core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st Century Competencies. 

All CCA emphasise social interaction by providing a common space for friendships and social integration amongst students of diverse backgrounds. Through CCA, students develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school.
