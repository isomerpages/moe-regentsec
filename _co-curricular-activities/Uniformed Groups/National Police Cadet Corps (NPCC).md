<p>In NPCC, we have a wide variety of exciting activities in store for our
cadets. These include outdoor adventure camps, crime science investigation,
shooting, campcraft and drills. Through these programmes, we emphasise
a lot on character building and instilling values such as resilience, integrity,
service and excellence. In addition, we also develop our cadets to become
active contributors and citizens to our community, through educating the
public on what they can do to help fight crime and keep Singapore safe.</p>
