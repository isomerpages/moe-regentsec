In NPCC, we have a wide variety of exciting activities in store for our cadets! These include outdoor adventure camps, crime science investigation, shooting, campcraft and drills! Through these programs, we emphasize a lot on character building, instilling values such as discipline, integrity, loyalty and tenacity. Not only that! We also develop our cadets to become active contributors and citizens to our community, through educating the public on what they can do to help fight crime and keep Singapore safe. While learning all these, we also made sure our cadets bond with their peers through the regular physical trainings and games sessions.
