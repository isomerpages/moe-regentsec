These include outdoor adventure camps, crime science investigation, shooting, campcraft and drills! Through these programs, we emphasize a lot on character building, instilling values such as discipline, integrity, loyalty and tenacity. Not only that! We also develop our cadets to become active contributors and citizens to our community, through educating the public on what they can do to help fight crime and keep Singapore safe. While learning all these, we also made sure our cadets bond with their peers through the regular physical trainings and games sessions.</p><h4>Activities</h4><p>Our unit activities include:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Participation in parade segment of NDP and NPAP</p></li><li><p>Live firing of .22 revolver</p></li><li><p>Cadet Leadership Camp</p></li><li><p>Adventure Training Camp (ATC)</p></li><li><p>Community Safety and Security Program</p></li><li><p>Police Youth Ambassador</p></li><li><p>Police Unarmed Tactics Course</p></li><li><p>Basic Law Course</p></li><li><p>Crime Prevention Course</p></li><li><p>Road Safety Course</p></li><li><p>Crime Scene Investigation Course (CSI)</p></li><li><p>Campcraft, pioneering and orienteering</p></li><li><p>Civil Defence</p></li><li><p>Total Defence</p></li><li><p>SANA (Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association)</p></li><li><p>Enrichment programmes such as dragon boating, air-pistol course and etc.</p></li><li><p>Visit to Singapore Discovery Centre, K-9 Unit, Police Heritage Centre and etc.</p></li></ul><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/2022%20NPCC%20Fun.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/NPCC/NPCC-1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/NPCC/NPCC-2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/NPCC/NPCC-3.jpg"></div><p></p>
