The 81st&nbsp;Girls’ Brigade @ Regent started in 2020 with 6 girls.&nbsp; This year, we have an additional 7 girls who joined us. The motto of Girls’ Brigade is “Every girl a servant leader”. Girls are given the opportunities to take on leadership roles and explore their strengths and weaknesses. In Girls’ Brigade, we hope to develop girls who are strong in character and have a willing heart to serve.

Every Girl in the Explorer’s Programme will:

*   Discover the World around around
*   Discover their role in the World around them
*   Discover the needs of others
*   Discover themselves
