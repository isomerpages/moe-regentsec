The Boys Brigade

The Boys’ Brigade is the world’s first uniformed organisation for youth. The impact of The Boys’ Brigade led to the establishment of other uniformed organisations: Girls’ Life Brigade (1902), Boy Scouts (1908) and Girl Guides (1910). Its founder Sir William Alexander Smith lived by this: “If I am to be remembered by posterity, I should like it to be as the man who taught people to spell Boy with a capital B.”

Thus the Boys’ Brigade at Regent believe in First for Boys! So every Boy is spelt with a capital “B”.
