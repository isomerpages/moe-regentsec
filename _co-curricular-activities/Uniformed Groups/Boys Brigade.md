The Boys‚Äô Brigade is the world‚Äôs first uniformed organisation for youth. The impact of The Boys‚Äô Brigade led to the establishment of other uniformed organisations: Girls‚Äô Life Brigade (1902), Boy Scouts (1908) and Girl Guides (1910). Its founder Sir William Alexander Smith lived by this: ‚ÄúIf I am to be remembered by posterity, I should like it to be as the man who taught people to spell Boy with a capital B.‚Äù

Thus the Boys‚Äô Brigade at Regent believe in First for Boys! So every Boy is spelt with a capital ‚ÄúB‚Äù.
