Under the baton of Mr Nigel Leong and Ms Ng Siang Yee, the Regent Concert Band aims to provide a nurturing environment for our members to acquire good musical knowledge and proficiency in playing musical instruments. We nurture our students to be self-directed learners and confident leaders while they take on various responsibilities in the band. We also provide ample opportunities for our members to take on leadership roles and learn through competitions, camps, and exchanges with schools from Singapore and overseas.
