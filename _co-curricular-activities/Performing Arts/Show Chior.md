Known for clinching the Best Showmanship award, Regent Revolution never fails to mesmerise the audience with our high impact production. We have dazzled the crowd performing as high school zombies and circus clowns, and always look forward to pull an element of surprise in our performances.

Regent Revolution Show Choir has come a long way and over the past few years, it has won numerous accolades, including the Certificate of Accomplishment at the 2019 SYF Arts Presentation (Choir) and numerous awards at the B-Dazzled Festival. The Regent Revolution Show Choir was also awarded the Show Choir of the Year for five consecutive years from 2013 to 2017.

Under the support and guidance of our school leaders, teachers-in-charge and professional instructors from John & Deniece Glee Studios, Regent Revolution Show Choir hopes to continue to develop itself in the aspects of singing and dancing by exposing the members to the Arts and providing them platforms to showcase their talents.
