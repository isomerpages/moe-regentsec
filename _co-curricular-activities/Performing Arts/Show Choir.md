Having consistently attained the Best Showmanship Award, Regent Revolution Show Choir never fails to mesmerise audiences with our high-impact productions. We have dazzled crowds, performed as high school zombies and circus clowns, and we always look forward to incorporating an element of surprise in our performances.

We have won numerous accolades, including the Certificate of Accomplishment at the 2019 Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and numerous awards at the B-Dazzled Music and Dance Festival. As a five-time Show Choir of the Year awardee, Regent Revolution Show Choir maintains its commitment to delivering show-stopping musical performances that seek to delight audiences young and old.

With the support and guidance of our school leaders, teachers, and professional instructors, Mr John Khoo and Mr Azizi, members of the Show Choir can look forward to honing their singing and dancing skills and to showcase their talents through various platforms.

With the onset of COVID-19 pandemic and safe management measures (SMM) in place, vocal and dance training went online during some periods of the past two years. . One project embarked by students was the&nbsp;**virtual choir project**. They worked in groups using Soundtrap, a cloud studio application, to record, upload and edit their singing tracks. It culminated in the virtual music showcase where students showcased their talents and receive feedback and motivation from their friends, choir instructor, and teachers.

Enjoy listening to a few samples of students‚Äô singing.
