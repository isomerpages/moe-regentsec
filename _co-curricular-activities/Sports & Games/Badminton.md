<p>Our weekly badminton trainings are conducted at the school’s Indoor Sports
Hall, where players receive coaching in a range of badminton techniques
and participate in physical conditioning sessions.</p>
<p>Each year, the team takes part in the <strong>National School Games 2025 (‘B’ and ‘C’ Division, Boys and Girls)</strong>,
gaining valuable experience and sportsmanship from the competition. To
further hone our players’ skills, we also engage in friendly matches with
other schools.</p>
<p>Beyond badminton, our members are exposed to a variety of sports such
as <strong>bowling, rock climbing, and trampoline</strong>, broadening their
physical experience and teamwork. Our <strong>Badminton student leaders</strong> take
the lead in planning the annual day camp, fostering leadership and collaboration.</p>
<p>In addition, our CCA members actively contribute to the community through <strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong> projects,
including <strong>PAssion Arts community sing-along sessions</strong> and <strong>beach clean-ups</strong>.
We have also initiated our own VIA projects — notably hosting <strong>badminton mixed doubles tournaments</strong> for <strong>Yew Tee residents, Regent students, and alumni</strong>,
strengthening our ties with the community.</p>
