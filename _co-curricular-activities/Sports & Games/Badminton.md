<h4>Highlights</h4>
<p>Badminton practices are held twice a week at our school’s Indoor Sports
Hall. Players are taught various badminton techniques by our coach during
training sessions. In addition, physical training activities are incorporated
into our sessions. We participated in the ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division (Boys and
Girls) West Zone National Inter-School Badminton Championships 2020 and
have gained invaluable insight through this experience. We also have friendly
matches with other schools to enhance our players’ skills.</p>
<p>Apart from gaining badminton skills, our members are also introduced to
other sports such as bowling, rock-climbing and trampoline. Badminton student
leaders also plan annual overnight camps where the students take charge
of the entire programme. Our CCA members had been actively involved in
VIA projects such as the Passion Arts community sing-along session and
SG50 Small Actions, Big Impact fund-raising activity. We also carry out
student-initiated VIA projects, hosting badminton mixed doubles tournaments
for Yew Tee residents, our own students and the Regent Badminton alumni.</p>
