Every student-athlete a dedicated sportsperson and competent leader.

#### Mission
Team Above Self, Sportsmanship and Character Above All.

#### About Us

The Regent Basketball CCA aims to nurture a team of dedicated student-athletes who strive for excellence and uphold the values of good character and sportsmanship on and off the court. 

Training is conducted twice a week in preparation for the National School Games ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division Basketball Championships, competitions such as the ActiveSG Cup and other invitational tournaments organised by schools or external organisations.

Our athletes also learn to organise and officiate during Intra-CCA competitions such as the Lower Secondary 3 v 3 Basketball Competition held at the end of Term 3 and the Regent Basketball Inter-Cohort 3 v 3 Competition during the December school holidays.

Besides playing basketball, our CCA members also do their part for the community through our annual CCA Values-in-Action (VIA) projects.
