Regent Basketball Team aims to provide opportunities to the passionate basketballers, developing them to have empathy for the society. The team trains twice a week and participates in National School Games as well as school friendly games. More efforts were put in other aspects such as student-led activities in annual team bonding Camp and CCA Values In Action (VIA) project. This provides a platform for the boys to display confidence and lead with pride.

#### **Key Activities:**

*   Annual team bonding camp
*   Enrichment Programme
*   Values In Action (VIA) Project
*   CCA Exchange Day
*   Intra-CCA games
*   Christmas function

Teamwork is essential for the students to do well in the sport. Ideally, we want to develop the sportsmanship and skill sets in students to upkeep their passion in the sport. In addition, students are involved in various activities such as enrichment programme to have exposure to a new skill set, or planning of VIA project to enrich the lives of others.

#### COVID-19 Period (2020-2021)

Several activities such as National School Games, team bonding camp and VIA project cannot be conducted. Face-to-face training sessions were conducted with Safe Management Measures (SMM). However, e-CCA sessions were conducted when face-to-face interactions were not possible. Some e-CCA sessions were conducted by the student leaders to emphasize on the desired traits of a sportsperson.

Students from Robotics had an exchange with the Basketball boys. Both CCA groups were introduced to new routines or drills that were exclusive to the CCA. The Basketball boys were given the opportunity to manipulate with the flying of drones and to build vehicles attached to the micro:bit to enable movement. The students from Robotics were exposed to Basketball drills and skill sets.
