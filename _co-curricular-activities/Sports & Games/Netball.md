<h4>About Us</h4>
<p>The Regent Netball Team is dedicated to developing passionate and resilient
players who embrace challenges, take charge of their growth, and embody
true sportsmanship on and off the court. With weekly trainings, our players
sharpen their skills, build strong bonds, and grow in confidence as they
compete in Zonal competitions and tournaments organised by Netball Singapore
and other sporting bodies.</p>
<p>In recent years, the team has demonstrated strong progress and determination.
We secured 4th place in the West Zone B Division Games in 2023 and rose
to 3rd place in 2025. Beyond the court, our players continue to shine in
endurance and teamwork, emerging as champions in the school’s Annual Cross
Country Run (CCA category) in 2025. In 2024, the team also clinched 1st
place in the Netops Sports Netball Carnival (U17 category), a testament
to their unity and skill.</p>
<p>At Regent, Netball is more than just a sport — it is a platform for our
students to grow as athletes, leaders, and individuals who inspire excellence
both on and off the court.</p>
