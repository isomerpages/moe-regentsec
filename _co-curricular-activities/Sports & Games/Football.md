The Regent Football Club aims to nurture a team of dedicated footballers who strive for excellence and uphold the values of good sportsmanship on and off the pitch.

Training is conducted twice a week in preparation for the National School Games ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division Football Championships, and other competitions.

Beyond the football pitch, our footballers are given the opportunity to actively contribute to the community through CCA-initiated Values-in-Action (VIA) projects.
