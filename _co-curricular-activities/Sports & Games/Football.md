The Regent Football Club aims to nurture a team of dedicated footballers who strive for excellence and uphold the values of good sportsmanship on and off the pitch.  

Training is conducted twice a week in preparation for the National School Games ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division Football Championships, and other competitions.
