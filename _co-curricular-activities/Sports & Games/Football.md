The Regent Football Club aims to nurture a team of dedicated footballers who strive for excellence and uphold the values of good sportsmanship on and off the pitch.

Beyond the football pitch, our footballers are also given the opportunity to actively contribute to the community through CCA-initiated Values-in-Action (VIA) projects.
