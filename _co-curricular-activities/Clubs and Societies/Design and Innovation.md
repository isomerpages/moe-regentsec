<p>The Design and Innovation Club was started with the vision of nurturing
young minds through design thinking to develop critical thinking and developing
confidence in generating, conceptualizing and communicating their ideas
to their teammates and consumers.</p>
<p>With this exposure, our young design entrepreneurs are able to identify
present day challenges with the mindset of providing possible ideas that
can potentially benefit the society. Students will also get the hands on
experience with topic research through conducting surveys and analyzing
statistics and conceptualizing ideas through hands on and engaging activities
like prototyping.</p>
<p>The aim for our members is to instill a positive attitude towards a problem-based
learning and to grow their interest for innovation. Student abilities are
further explored with the submission of their ideas and prototypes for
competitions such as the Tan Kah Kee Young Inventorâ€™s Award.</p>
