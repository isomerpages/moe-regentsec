Sound, lights, cameras, ACTION! Regent Infocomm Technology (Media Production) is the space where we make dreams come to (reel) life. We provide experiential opportunities for students who are interested in photography, audio visual technology and media production. Our core duty is to support the school community with photography, videography and assistance in using audio-visual equipment. We also educate our members on Cyber Wellness and participate in the National Cyber Wellness Advocacy Challenge (NCAC) annually. Our members get our creative juices flowing while working on website designing and  filmmaking. Our members develop  a flair for story telling and a passion for the screen.

**Movie Making**              
Our members acquire a range of filmmaking knowledge including writing, directing, cinematography, sound, editing and producing. As we develop our storyboards and get involved in the whole production process,  we acquire core skills to be a better filmmaker, to understand cinema critically and creatively, and realise our potential as an individual.

**Website Creation**   
Our students try their hands on website building. Building a website is a good way to learn skills such as media content creation and search engine optimisation. In this series of sessions, we used Wix.com to create websites about our diverse interests. In addition to content creation on websites, we are also looking at developing competencies in creating dynamic content for other social media platforms such as YouTube.

**Developing Cyber Wellness Awareness**   
Our students participate in the annual National Cyber Wellness Advocacy Challenge. Over the years, the challenges have equipped our students with strategies to ensure their well-being in cyberspace. Through the challenges, the students also developed other invaluable skills as they plan and execute their annual outreach programmes.

**DigiGirlz**   
Even when school’s out, learning continues for our members as they participate in the annual DigiGirlz programme organised by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and Microsoft. Every year, the young ladies in our CCA to learn about careers in technology, connect with Microsoft employees, and participate in hands-on computer and technology workshops. Working alongside the young ladies in the CCA, the young gentlemen also learn invaluable soft skills in addition to technical skills. For instance, they learn to collaborate on diverse teams and respect individuals with talent.
