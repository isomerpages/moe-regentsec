Guided by our mission to equip all students and staff to become responsible advocates of the environment, our environmental programmes seek to promote good environmental habits and involve the wider community in environmental efforts. This year, our school’s project focused on upcycling as a way to “be the change” in working towards sustainable living through conserving resources.</p><p>Our students from the Environmental Sciences Club led the school-wide effort to turn used items into new products, including mask holders, tote bags, and coin banks. Ongoing recycling and energy-saving efforts have also helped us become a greener school. Through this, we have effected a positive environmental impact in our school and community.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Environmental%20Science/ENVSCI-1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Environmental%20Science/ENVSCI-2.jpg"></div><h4>Club Activities</h4><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p>Every Singaporean a Naturalist (ESN) programme to observe birds in school</p></li><li><p>Upcycling workshops (e.g. making of tote bags from old clothes, making of paper wallets, upcycled fabric and plastic bottle holders)</p></li><li><p>Nature Journaling</p></li><li><p>Litter Picking</p></li><li><p>Gardening activities</p></li><li><p>Learning Journey</p></li><li><p>Advocating for different environmental causes in school and at the community level (e.g. water and energy conservation, e-waste recycling, public health, reducing food wastage)</p></li><li><p>National Youth Upcycling Movement (Sec 3)</p></li><li><p>Training of Environment Champions to be advocates in each class</p></li><li><p>Reduce@Northwest</p></li><li><p>NYP Design Thinking and Innovation Boot Camp 2020</p></li><li><p>Starhub E-Waste Challenge 2021</p></li><li><p>Limbang PassionArts 2022</p></li></ul><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Environmental%20Science/ENVSCI-3.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/CCA/Environmental%20Science/ENVSCI-4.jpg"></div><p></p>
