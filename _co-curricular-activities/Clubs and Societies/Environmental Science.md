<p>We achieved the <strong>Yellow Flame Award</strong>&nbsp;at the School
Green Awards 2024. Guided by our mission to equip all students and staff
to become responsible advocates of the environment, Regent's environmental
programmes seek to promote good environmental habits and involve the wider
community in environmental efforts. Our schoolâ€™s project focused on upcycling
as a way to "be the change" in working towards sustainable living through
conserving resources.</p>
<p>Our students from the Environmental Sciences Club led the school-wide
effort to turn used items into new products, including tote bags, paper
bags, plastic zipper containers and small gift box. Ongoing recycling and
energy-saving efforts have also helped us become a greener school. We also
seek to partner with CCAs and organisations to further effect a positive
environmental impact in our school and community.</p>
