engaging and meaningful learning opportunities. As part of these experiences,
the school reserves the right to capture photographs and videos during
various activities, including but not limited to classroom lessons, co-curricular
activities (CCA), camps, enrichment programs, competitions, and overseas
learning trips.</p>
<p>The school holds all rights to reproduce these images and videos across
multiple platforms, including print, digital media, and social channels.
We want to assure parents and guardians that all representations of our
students will be handled with respect and dignity at all times.</p>
