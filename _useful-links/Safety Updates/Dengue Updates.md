Dengue Updates
==============

The number of dengue cases in 2016 could exceed 30,000 – higher than the record in 2013 when 22,170 cases were reported – unless immediate measures are taken to reduce the _Aedes_ mosquito population. The same _Aedes_ mosquito also transmits the Zika virus, and with the threat of Zika infection looming, it is critical to reduce the mosquito population.  Prevention of mosquito breeding and vector control remain the mainstay to prevent transmission of both viruses.

While the Government, various stakeholders and volunteers continue with stepped-up measures to rid potential mosquito breeding habitats in public areas, members of the community are urged to rid potential mosquito breeding habitats in their homes. The majority of mosquito breeding is still being found in homes, with most breeding habitats found in domestic containers and flower pot plates/trays.

The National Environment Agency will be launching the annual ‘Do the Mozzie Wipeout’ Campaign 2016 on Sunday, 28 February 2016, ahead of the traditional dengue peak season. The campaign calls for the community to take appropriate precautions to prevent mosquito breeding by practising the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout in their homes and premises. Starting from 28 February, a concerted effort by all over a 14-day period will address two rounds of mosquito breeding cycle, and this will make a collective impact towards suppressing the population.

We would like to invite your school to join us in the collective action by clearing your premises of mosquito breeding, screen the attached eDM on your online portals (incl. social media) and broadcast the message to all staff and students to get them to join the fight against Dengue/Zika by doing the 5-step mozzie wipeout in their homes and to keep your premise mosquito-free. The eDM could be accompanied with the suggested message:

### _“Protect our families and loved ones against dengue. Do the 5-Step #MozzieWipeout.”_
