Together Regent Cares 2021
==========================

Regent Secondary School celebrates National Day on 6 August (Friday), themed Together Our Singapore Spirit.

With Safe Management Measures in mind, the students were able to observe and participate in the National Day Observance Ceremony, singing the National Anthem and taking the National Pledge in their respective classrooms. Interactive class activities, such as Bingo and Kahoot Quiz also provided opportunities for the students to bond and understand more about our island nation. Students were also given the opportunities to pen down their hopes and aspirations for the country as we celebrate our nation’s 56th birthday.

National Day Celebrations was an especially meaningful occasion as the National Day Celebrations marks the culmination of our two-week long Together RegentCares Values-in-Action Community Outreach and provided opportunities to showcase and reflect on our contributions to the Limbang Community and the larger Marsiling – Yew Tee GRC.

During the Celebrations, students managed to catch a preview of the amazing performances by our Show Choir and English Drama, which were broadcast during the Marsiling – Yew Tee GRC National Day online celebrations. Students also had a glimpse of the intricate artwork of our National Day artefact display for Stagmont Park RC, which went on to win the first place in the Inter-RC National Day Decoration Competition.

For Together RegentCares, in line with the theme of Environment and Sustainability, our student councilors and environment champions served as advocates to rally the students to commit themselves to an environmental-friendly lifestyle. Our students were taught how to encourage their friends and family to pledge and make conscientious changes to save the environment. This is a Reduce@NorthWest initiative in partnership with NorthWest CDC. The students also took the opportunity to prepare gratitude cards for our frontline workers to show their appreciation to these workers who kept Singapore safety amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Classes, CCAs and teachers also prepared care packs for the elderly from Methodist Welfare Services Nursing Home and Lion Befrienders, to bring them some joy and recognition of their contributions in nation-building. The National Day Celebrations provide a checkpoint for us to reflect and dream of how the Regent family can contribute to our wider community to make a difference.

Come whatever on the road ahead, we did it before and we will do it again.
