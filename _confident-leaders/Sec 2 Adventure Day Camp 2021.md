Secondary 2 Adventure Camp 2021
===============================

As part of MOE’s Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) programme, Regent Secondary has arranged for a 3-Day OAL for Secondary 2 at MOE Labrador OAL Centre from 18 March to 20 March 2021, 7.20pm-5.30pm.

The non-residential OAL is part of the school’s effort to provide a holistic learning experience for each student in view of the COVID-19 situation. The Secondary 2 Outdoor Adventure Day Camp provided an opportunity for the cognitive and social-emotional development of our students. Throughout this day camp, students were provided the opportunities to overcome physical and mental challenges through outdoor adventure activities.

On Day 1 of the camp, we kick-started the programme with team building activities where campers bonded through overcoming challenges such as building tents from scratch. The activities taught them the importance of communicating effectively and working together as a team. Campers also learnt about outdoor cooking, where they cooked up a bowl of beehoon soup from several basic ingredients. Not only did they learn how to prepare a healthy meal, they also learnt how to prepare the food safely and how to start and manage fire safely, with the opportunity to taste their own cooking at the end. It was a certainly a delightful experience as it was the first time cooking for many.

On Day 2 of the camp, we were greeted with a warm and sunny welcome! Our campers hit the beach to learn the intricacies of building a raft-from knot-tying to lashing skills. They showed great determination and perseverance in the face of a difficult challenge and were soon water-ready with their unsinkable rafts. Following the water adventure, our young explorers headed out to the Labrador Nature Reserve to uncover its rich heritage, including the significant role it played during World War II. It was definitely a fun-filled day in the sun.

For the last day of the camp, the campers were challenged to complete a range of challenges in exactly 39 minutes. In the “39 Minutes to Win It” challenge, campers learnt the importance of teamwork and communication as they worked together. The camp was rounded off with a kayaking session at the Pandan Reservoir. As they paddled back to shore, it also marked the end of a beautiful experience for our students who had persevered through the 3-day camp.

All in all, our students seized the opportunities to overcome challenges through the different activities and emerged as physically and mentally stronger individuals. We hope the important lessons learnt will continue to shape them and holistically develop them throughout their remaining time in Regent Secondary School!
