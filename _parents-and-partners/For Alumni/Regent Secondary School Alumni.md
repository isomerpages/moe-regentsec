### **Purpose of Regent Secondary Alumni**

1.  Provide opportunities and platforms for our Alumni to continue to serve the school in various ways and lead Regenities to be developed into self-directed learners and confident leaders.
2.  Provide a place for all Regenites (current and Alumni) to gather, as good stories and fond memories shared by the Alumni will strengthen the Regent family and inspire and influence our students to pursue excellence.
