<p>The MOE GPA insurance is provided for all students in government and government
aided schools at no cost to parents. This insurance covers students for
accidents that may occur during school hours, during school-related activities,
and while students are travelling directly to and from school, subject
to the policy's claim limits.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that students seek treatment at public healthcare
institutions to ensure sufficient coverage under the MOE GPA insurance
scheme. As private hospitals charge significantly higher medical costs,
there may be more out-of-pocket expenses for parents/guardians as there
are caps to the MOE GPA insurance.</p>
