<h3><strong>School Fees</strong></h3>
<p>You can apply for your child’s&nbsp;school and miscellaneous fees&nbsp;to
be paid through GIRO. The same GIRO arrangement will also be extended to
cover their payment of enrichment programmes, school charges and deduction
of national examination fees (Primary School Leaving Examination and GCE
Examinations), where applicable.</p>
