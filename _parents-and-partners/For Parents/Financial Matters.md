## **School Fees**

You can apply for your child’s school and miscellaneous fees to be paid through GIRO. The same GIRO arrangement will also be extended to cover their payment of enrichment programmes, school charges and deduction of national examination fees (Primary School Leaving Examination and GCE Examinations), where applicable.
