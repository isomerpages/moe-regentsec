<p>There is no hard and fast rule book for raising children, but it is surprising
how many familiar parenting problems have very simple solutions. From anger
outbursts, tantrums, defiance, unhealthy gaming habits to establishing
a regular homework routine â€“ the issues you face arenâ€™t unique to your
family. In fact, they are commonplace. That is why&nbsp;<a href="https://www.triplep-parenting.net/global/triple-p/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Triple P Positive Parenting Programmes</a>&nbsp;can
help.</p>
<p>Triple P is one of the few parenting programmes in the world that is based
on strategies proven by research. It is a multi-level strategy designed
to suit various parenting needs as it aims to promote children and teensâ€™
psychological, social, and emotional competence. Parents who attend the
sessions will receive complimentary Triple P resources (subject to terms
and conditions).</p>
<p>Regent Secondary School has partnered with Fei Yue Community Services,
the appointed Parenting Support Provider (PSP) for the Bukit Batok/ Bukit
Panjang/ Choa Chu Kang region to support you in your parenting journey.
