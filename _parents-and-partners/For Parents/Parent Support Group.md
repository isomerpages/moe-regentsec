The Parent Support Group (PSG) is a great opportunity for us to be closer to our children, understand them better, and help them in their education journey.

Our children also benefit when we are more active in their school environment. 
They tend to: 
* show more positive attitudes 
* have better school attendance and complete homework more consistently 
* be able to bridge the cultural gap between school and home 
* be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues

In Regent, the PSG partners and supports the school by volunteering 3 Ts:

The PSG programmes in 2024 include:
* Parenting talks such as Triple P Online and school-based parenting talks
* Parent-child bonding activities 
* Participation in school activities such as Total Defence Day,  Teachersâ€™ Day celebrations, etc.
