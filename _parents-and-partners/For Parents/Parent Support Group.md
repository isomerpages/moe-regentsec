The Parent Support Group(PSG)@Regent offers a plethora of opportunities for parents to connect, share, and support one another through the highs and lows of parenting. The PSG@Regent provides guidance in parenting skills and fosters solidarity between parents as we navigate the beautiful yet challenging journey of raising teenagers. Through the PSG, you will find a community of empathetic parents ready to share experiences, offer advice, and lend a compassionate ear. 

The PSG also provides invaluable benefits to students by fostering a collaborative and supportive educational environment. The group offers parents a platform to engage with each other, teachers, and school administrators, thereby strengthening the home-school partnership. As parents become more involved in their child's education, students benefit from increased parental engagement, which has been consistently linked to improved academic performance, higher attendance rates, and better behavior in school. Thus, by rendering support through the PSG, parents are undoubtedly, creating a more enriching and supportive school community that ultimately enhances students' overall well-being and learning experience. As a result, our children tend to:
* show more positive attitudes towards learning
* have better school attendance and complete homework more consistently 
* be able to bridge the cultural gap between school and home 
* be less anti-social and less prone to behavioural issues

In Regent, the PSG partners and supports the school by volunteering through the 3 Ts:
