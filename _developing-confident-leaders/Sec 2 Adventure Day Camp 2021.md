Secondary 2 Adventure Camp 2021
===============================

As part of MOE’s Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) programme, Regent Secondary has arranged for a 3-Day OAL for Secondary 2 at MOE Labrador OAL Centre from 18 March to 20 March 2021, 7.20pm-5.30pm.

The non-residential OAL is part of the school’s effort to provide a holistic learning experience for each student in view of the COVID-19 situation. The Secondary 2 Outdoor Adventure Day Camp provided an opportunity for the cognitive and social-emotional development of our students. Throughout this day camp, students were provided the opportunities to overcome physical and mental challenges through outdoor adventure activities.

On Day 1 of the camp, we kick-started the programme with team building activities where campers bonded through overcoming challenges such as building tents from scratch. The activities taught them the importance of communicating effectively and working together as a team. Campers also learnt about outdoor cooking, where they cooked up a bowl of beehoon soup from several basic ingredients. Not only did they learn how to prepare a healthy meal, they also learnt how to prepare the food safely and how to start and manage fire safely, with the opportunity to taste their own cooking at the end. It was a certainly a delightful experience as it was the first time cooking for many.
