# Overview
National Education (NE) was launched in 1987. A significant aspect of CCE, NE comprises a wide range of school efforts that aims to:

1.  Provide out students with the knowledge, skills and values to understand Singapore’s history, realities and challenges unique to our nation, appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future.
2.  Be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making, so as to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking and informed about local, regional and global issues.
3.  Help our students experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans and foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and hope which motivates our students to play a contributory role in their immediate communities and in the nation while they seek to achieve their personal life goals.

Key Dispositions
----------------

The following key dispositions for citizenship shape the purpose and approach to NE:

1.  **A Sense of Belonging:** To develop a deeper understanding of who we are as Singaporeans, and a shared understanding of the values that are important to us as a nation.
2.  **A Sense of Reality:** To be aware of the contemporary realities — including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.
3.  **A Sense of Hope:** To have confidence and optimism in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.
4.  **(Culminating in) The Will to Act:** To be active citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards building a Singapore for all.

NE Experiences
--------------

Students go through various NE experiences such as values-in-action projects, cohort learning journeys, flag raising ceremonies and NRIC presentation ceremonies. However, the highlights for each year would be the NE Commemorative Days that are observed as a school. These are:

### 1) Total Defence Day **(commemorated yearly on 15th February)**

Total Defence Day (TDD) marks the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in 1942. Schools commemorate TDD for our students to reflect on how Total Defence remains our best all-round response to threats and challenges that confront Singapore (e.g. terrorism, pandemics, cyber-attacks, influence campaigns, economic crises). They also reflect on the continuing relevance of the six Total Defence pillars (military, civil, economic, social, digital and psychological) and the core message of every Singaporean standing together, with each playing our part to protect Singapore and our shared way of life.
