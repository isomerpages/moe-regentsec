Aspirations Day 2021
====================

The Aspirations Camp aims to allow students to:

*   have greater exposure to available paths for tertiary education
*   empower students to take charge of their personal career planning and development
*   have greater awareness about the world of work and types of job in Singapore

In view of safety measures amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, 2021’s Aspirations Camp is organized in two segments, namely a series of Career Talks from 8 February to 8 March and an Aspirations Day on 19 March.

### Career Talks

Industry partners from seven different industries are invited to interact with our students. Through these interactions, our students develop a greater awareness of the skills and values needed to excel in the world of work.

The seven industries include Healthcare, Banking and Finance, Entrepreneurship (Food & Beverage), Hospitality & Tourism, Aerospace, Engineering and Cybersecurity.
