## Regent Goes to Camp!

Held at Dairy Farm over 3 days, the camp aims to give students the unique opportunity to develop their love for the outdoors as well as their resilience in braving weather elements to overcome physical challenges.

### Day 1

On the first day of the camp, our students bravely scaled the high elements course that included traipsing narrow planks and tight ropes cumulating into a thrilling zip line finish. Many were initially daunted by the heights, but overcame their fears by slowly building up their confidence on the low tier course before advancing to the higher tier ones. It was heartening to hear the encouraging cheers of every class spurring their peers on through each and every obstacle.

Students also showed off their culinary skills with their creative methods to fully utilize an orange to cook the most flavorful muffin. Savoring their delicious muffins made by hand was the perfect finishing touch to end the day! Despite the sudden downpour in the late afternoon, it was indeed a thrilling day for our Secondary One students.

### Day 2

Our campers eagerly tried their hands one of the favourite activities of our pioneers –Longkang Fishing. They had a go at making fish traps and experiencing bare-handed fishing in a natural stream. The students found comfortable spots along the Longkang and practiced their fishing skills patiently in hopes of netting a colorful guppy! Many were so excited about successfully catching a fish for the first time.

In the afternoon, they embarked on scenic trail along the hillside to experience the rich flora and fauna where they found themselves constantly amazed by the beauty of one of the hidden natural gems of Singapore.
