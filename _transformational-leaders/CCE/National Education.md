<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>National Education (NE) was launched in 1987. A significant aspect of
CCE, NE comprises a wide range of school efforts that aims to:</p>
<p>1. Provide out students with the knowledge, skills and values to understand
Singapore’s history, realities and challenges unique to our nation, appreciate
our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival as a nation,
and have confidence in our nation’s future.</p>
<p>2. Be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making,
so as to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical
thinking and informed about local, regional and global issues.</p>
<p>3. Help our students experience and explore their national identity as
Singaporeans and foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and hope
which motivates our students to play a contributory role in their immediate
communities and in the nation while they seek to achieve their personal
life goals.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Dispositions</strong></h4>
<p>The following key dispositions for citizenship shape the purpose and approach
to NE:</p>
<p>1. <strong>A Sense of Belonging:</strong>&nbsp;To develop a deeper understanding
of who we are as Singaporeans, and a shared understanding of the values
that are important to us as a nation.</p>
<p>2. <strong>A Sense of Reality:</strong>&nbsp;To be aware of the contemporary
realities — including Singapore’s constraints and vulnerabilities — which
affect us as a nation amidst the backdrop of a less predictable world.</p>
<p>3. <strong>A Sense of Hope:</strong>&nbsp;To have confidence and optimism
in Singapore’s future and the resilience to face the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>4. <strong>(Culminating in) The Will to Act:</strong>&nbsp;To be active
citizens who have a collective resolve and a sense of shared mission towards
building a Singapore for all.</p>
<h4><strong>NE Experiences</strong></h4>
<p>Students go through various NE experiences such as values-in-action projects,
cohort learning journeys, flag raising ceremonies and NRIC presentation
ceremonies. However, the highlights for each year would be the NE Commemorative
Days that are observed as a school. These are:</p>
<h4>1) Total Defence Day (commemorated yearly on 15th&nbsp;February)</h4>

<p>Total Defence Day (TDD) marks the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in
1942. Schools commemorate TDD for our students to reflect on how Total
Defence remains our best all-round response to threats and challenges that
confront Singapore (e.g. terrorism, pandemics, cyber-attacks, influence
campaigns, economic crises). They also reflect on the continuing relevance
of the six Total Defence pillars (military, civil, economic, social, digital
and psychological) and the core message of every Singaporean standing together,
with each playing our part to protect Singapore and our shared way of life.</p>
<h4>2) International Friendship Day (commemorated on the 3rd&nbsp;Friday of Term 2)</h4>

have commemorated National Day for students to reflect on the historical
importance and solemnity of National Day.</p>
