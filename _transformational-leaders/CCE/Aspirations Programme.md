<p>Aspiration Programme
<br>(2–7 January 2026)
<br>
<br>Regent Secondary School’s Aspirations Programme is anchored on the 4-D
Education and Career Guidance (ECG) approach — Discover, Decide, Develop
and Dream. Through a structured 4- to 5-year developmental journey, students
are guided to discover their strengths and interests, make informed decisions,
and work purposefully towards their aspired educational pathways and careers.
<br>During the programme, students participated in various Start Right ECG
cohort activities, which encouraged them to revisit their ECG goals and
strengthen their motivation to realise their dreams.</p>
<p><u>Secondary Two: Career Life Game Design</u>
<br>Secondary Two students engaged in the Career Life Game Design, an experiential
learning programme that introduced career exploration through interactive,
real-life scenarios. Through game-based activities, students made decisions,
encountered challenges, and reflected on their interests, strengths, and
values. The programme fostered self-awareness, adaptability, and forward
planning, empowering students to take ownership of their future pathways
with greater confidence.
<br>
<br><u>Upper Secondary: Regent Discovers Aspirations</u>
<br>Upper secondary students participated in Regent Discovers Aspirations,
a series of learning experiences designed to broaden their understanding
of post-secondary pathways and the world of work.
<br>Secondary Four students visited Singapore Polytechnic and Ngee Ann Polytechnic,
where they enjoyed hands-on experiences facilitated by polytechnic students
and participated in the “Find Your Dream” workshop, which helped them better
prepare for post-secondary education.
<br>
<br>In addition, this year marked the inaugural year where all Secondary Four
students took part in industry learning journeys, gaining firsthand exposure
to real work environments. Students visited the Building and Construction
Authority (BCA), Singapore Youth Flying Club, and Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital,
where they observed professionals at work and gained valuable industry
insights.</p>
<p>The annual Start Right Programme also featured guest speakers from various
professions, including Aviation and Healthcare. Through these sessions,
students gained insights into different careers, explored possible pathways,
and interacted directly with industry professionals.
<br>
<br>Overall, the Aspirations Programme provided meaningful exposure and inspiration,
empowering students to take confident steps towards achieving their educational
and career aspirations.</p>
