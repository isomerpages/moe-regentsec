## Secondary 1 Orientation 2023

A blazing start to the year.

We welcome our Regenites back to school, including our Sec 1 students to the Regent Family.

The Sec 1 students had the opportunity to discover more about the teachers, their classmates and the school through a series of games and activities. The week-long orientation ended with a campfire and student performances,  a Regent tradition where we invite parents to witness their child’s initiation and transition to Secondary School.
