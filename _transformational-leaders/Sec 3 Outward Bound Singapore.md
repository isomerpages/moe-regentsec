<p>The MOE-OBS Challenge Programme was conducted from 14 to 18 July. A total
of 178 adventurous Secondary 3 students took part in the 5-day/4-night
residential programme designed to foster resilience, teamwork, and leadership.
The programme was held across three locations — OBS campuses at Pulau Ubin,
Punggol, and East Coast — offering a rich and diverse outdoor experience.</p>
<p>Throughout the five days, students were pushed beyond their comfort zones
through a series of physically and mentally demanding activities. Highlights
included a land expedition where students navigated trails while carrying
their gear, a high ropes challenge that tested their courage and trust,
and rafting sessions that required teamwork and problem-solving under pressure.</p>

<p>Participants also learned to be self-reliant, taking charge of cooking
their own meals and managing their daily routines in an outdoor environment.
Through these experiences, students developed important life skills such
as perseverance, adaptability, and effective communication.</p>
<p>More than just an adventure, the MOE-OBS Challenge Programme served as
a platform for students to build stronger bonds with their peers and grow
as individuals. Many came away from the camp with newfound confidence,
a deeper appreciation for nature, and lasting memories of overcoming challenges
together.</p>
<p>This immersive experience exemplifies the school’s commitment to holistic
education and the development of character and leadership among its students.
Congratulations to all participants for rising to the challenge and making
the most of this unique opportunity!</p>
