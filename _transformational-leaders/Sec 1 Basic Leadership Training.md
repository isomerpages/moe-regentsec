<p>In the early morning hours of 2 July, students dressed in sportswear and
hauling oversized backpacks could be seen streaming through the gates of
the school and towards the Netball Court. It was the first day of the Secondary
1 Cohort Camp. For many students, this was to be their first residential
camp experience. With an air of eager anticipation, our campers soon boarded
the buses and headed off to the MOE Changi Coast Outdoor Adventure Learning
Centre—their home for the next four days!</p>
<p>The 4-day 3-night camp was organised with the intent of giving our students
the opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills learnt during their Outdoor
Education lessons in PE. Students had been taught basic map-reading and
navigation skills in school and they had the opportunity to put theory
into practice as they navigated their way along East Coast Park for a full-day
mini-expedition. Laden with personal gear and group essentials like groundsheets
and meal rations, students rallied together, sharing the load and encouraging
one another every step of the 10km hike. Although the students were tired
by the time they returned to the campsite, there was a palpable sense of
achievement and camaraderie, having conquered the trail together as one!</p>
<p>Part of the camp experience also included having to cook their own meals.
All students were given the opportunity to prepare either lunch or dinner
during the Outdoor Cooking session. It was left to the creativity of the
campers to concoct culinary delights with ingredients on hand! From creative
macaroni dishes to delicious secret sauce recipes, each meal was a testament
to their resourcefulness and teamwork.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t all about ground-level challenges—students were also urged
to reach new heights, both literally and metaphorically. Ziplining, rockwall-climbing,
and abseiling gave students the opportunity to step out of their comfort
zones, proving that courage is not the absence of fear but the triumph
over it. Another highlight of camp was caving, where students navigated
an Artificial Caving System in total darkness. Crawling and feeling their
way through narrow passages, they discovered resilience and learnt to trust
in themselves and their peers.</p>
<p>As the camp drew to a close, it was clear that these four days had left
an indelible mark on the Secondary 1 cohort. They had faced challenges
head-on, discovered hidden strengths, and forged friendships through shared
experiences. More than just an adventure, the Cohort Camp was a journey
of personal growth and discovery—a foundation upon which they will build
their future endeavours.</p>
<p>While the tents may be packed away and the campfire stories may fade,
the lessons learned amidst the trees and trails will undoubtedly continue
to shape their outlook and actions. For our young Regenites, this camp
was not just a milestone—it was a springboard into a year filled with newfound
confidence and resilience.</p>
