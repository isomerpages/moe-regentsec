<h2>Learning for Life Programme - Community Youth Leadership (CYL)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Youths are the future leaders and changemakers of society. Guided by the
school’s mission of nurturing transformational leaders, the Learning for
Life Programme (LLP) - Community Youth Leadership (CYL) provides authentic
learning experiences to nurture student agents who are able to contribute
back to society based on their own interests and passions. Through our
LLP-CYL, Regent Secondary School aims to empower every Regenite to be a
responsible and transformational leader who is committed to excellence.
To realise every student's potential, every student is given the opportunity
to hone their leadership skills in either the classroom setting, CCAs,
or in the Student Council so that they can lead themselves, their peers,
and the community. Regnites have opportunities to engage in community-based
leadership experiences, allowing them to develop their leadership skills
while cultivating a heart for service.</p>
<h4>Tier 1 Leadership - Cohort Experiences</h4>
<p>The Regent Leadership Programme, based on the 5 exemplary practices of
the Leadership Challenge, aims to equip our students with the knowledge
and competencies to be a Transformational Leader. The programme concludes
with a capstone class Values in Action (VIA) project for the students to
apply what they have learnt during the Leadership Programme.</p>
<p>The Leadership Programme is carried out from Sec 1 to Sec 3 and follows
the following structure:</p>
<p><strong>SEC 1: SELF-LEADERSHIP</strong>
</p>
<p>To help the Sec 1 students to make the transition to Secondary School,
the programme focuses on equipping the students with personal skills, focusing
on personal etiquette and time management skills, to teach our students
to be independent and responsible individuals. The Sec 1 Leadership Programme
also aims at imbuing in our students a basic understanding of the Five
Exemplary Practices of The Leadership Challenge.</p>
<p><strong>SEC 2: PEER LEADERSHIP</strong>
</p>
<p>Building on the Sec 1 Leadership Programme, the Sec 2 Leadership Programme
provides opportunities for students to learn to work and collaborate in
teams effectively. One of the most important prerequisites of a good team
player is the ability to be an effective communicator. Thus, a key focus
of the programme is on public speaking and facilitation skills, which will
better prepare them for group and project work in and beyond the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>SEC 3: TEAM LEADERSHIP</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Sec 3 students are the ones who will take up the mantle of leadership
in school, whether in their respective Co-Curricular Activities or in their
classes. The Sec 3 Leadership Programme focus on providing authentic scenarios
for students to clarify their leadership styles and decision-making so
that students will be better able to assume their leadership roles.</p>

<p><strong>VALUES IN ACTION (VIA)</strong>
</p>
<p>Being a leader is nothing without contribution. Our CYL programmes aim
to develop student’s character, leadership and spirit for volunteering.
Beyond the leadership programmes, the CYL programme provides our students
with VIA platforms and opportunities to take actions to reach out and make
a difference in the school and community. This is done in a carefully scaffolded
manner, culminating in student-initiated class VIA projects in Sec 1, Sec
2 and Sec 3 with the Sec 4 students serving as mentors to them.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Tier 2 Leadership – Class Committee</h4>
<p><strong>CLASS COMMITTEE</strong>
</p>
<p>Every Regenite has a part to play in making their class a caring and united
community. Our Class Committee members take on unique roles that amplify
class communication, strengthen peer relationships, and promote a positive
class spirit. Each member champions an area of specialization — be it environment,
welfare or subject area—and leads their peers through class advocacy projects
that bring these values to life. Together, they play an active role in
shaping a supportive and inclusive class culture and environment.</p>
<p>Beyond the classroom, Class Committee members contribute to school-wide
initiatives such as the CCE Gratitude Fair, Racial Harmony Day, World Environment
Day, Teachers’ Day Celebrations, and Values-In-Action projects. Through
these experiences, they learn the importance of teamwork, responsibility
and service, while helping to build a vibrant and values-driven school
community.</p>
<p>In Regent, our Class Committee members embody what it means to serve,
to lead and to transform — in their classes, their school, and beyond.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>PEER SUPPORT LEADERS</strong>
</p>
<p>The school is a place where students develop strong friendships. Positive
peer relationships facilitate the provision of care and a sense of belonging
amongst students. Such relationships can also be powerful channels of positive
influence—just take a look at our Peer Support Leaders (PSL)!</p>
<p>Every class has at least 2 PSLs who are trained in the three domains of
peer support and relationships: peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing.
PSLs also attend rich experiences like Dialogue in the Dark and Goalball
to develop their sense of empathy for others.</p>
<p>Apart from regularly organising peer bonding facilities to foster strong
relationships in the classrooms, PSLs embark on advocacy projects to encourage
their classmates to have strong webs of friendships. Such projects include
promoting healthy conversations among peers, and promoting mental well-being.
PSLs are also trained to look out and support their peers who may require
more social resources.</p>
<p>In Regent, every student is a peer supporter. Our PSLs proudly lead their
peers to create a strong and supporting learning environment in the classrooms
and beyond!</p>

<h4>Tier 3 Leadership – Student Leaders</h4>
<p>The Student Leaders in Regent serve as the voice of the student body,
advocating for their peers and fostering a vibrant and caring school culture.
Our Student Councillors and CCA leaders undergo customised facilitation
and project management training to equip them with the confidence and skills
to lead with purpose and empathy. Within their respective areas, the student
leaders guide their peers, facilitate reflection sessions, and promote
meaningful learning experiences, helping to build strong, supportive communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Student Councillors and CCA Leaders play key roles in major school events
such as Secondary One Orientation, Awards Day, Teachers’ Day Celebrations,
and Sports Fiesta, taking on responsibilities from emceeing and ushering
to event planning and execution. They also facilitate In-Class Conversations
and platforms like Voices of the Day (VOTD), sharing messages during morning
assemblies that raise awareness on school values, well-being, and reflections
on experiences such as Overseas Learning Journeys and the Limbang Mid-Autumn
Festival. These opportunities allow them to exemplify the 4A approach of
Awareness, Action, Amplification, and Application, strengthening student
engagement and learning.</p>
<p>Beyond the school, Student Councillors and CCA Leaders represent Regent
at community events, such as the Limbang 10th Anniversary, Voices of Youth
and Limbang Mid-Autumn Festival, fostering meaningful connections with
the wider community and nurturing a spirit of service. They also participate
in the W6 Student Leaders Collaboration with Assumption English School
and Unity Secondary School, exchanging ideas and exploring the Leadership
Challenge Model to refine their leadership practices. In response to student
feedback, the Student Council has also championed initiatives such as the
Book Donation Drive (in partnership with the Environmental Science CCA),
promoting sustainability and peer support through the sharing of pre-loved
books.</p>
<p>At the heart of their service, our Student Councillors and CCA Leaders
lead with courage, empathy, and conviction — living out the Regent spirit
to serve, to lead and to transform.</p>
