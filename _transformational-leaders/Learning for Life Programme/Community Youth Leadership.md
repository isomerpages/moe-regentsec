<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Youths are the future leaders and changemakers of society. Guided by the
schoolâ€™s mission of nurturing transformational leaders, the Learning for
Life Programme (LLP) - Community Youth Leadership (CYL) provides authentic
learning experiences to nurture student agents who are able to contribute
back to society based on their own interests and passions. Through our
LLP-CYL, Regent Secondary School aims to empower every Regenite to be a
responsible and transformational leader who is committed to excellence.
To realise every student's potential, every student is given the opportunity
to hone their leadership skills in either the classroom setting, CCAs,
or in the Student Council so that they can lead themselves, their peers,
and the community. Regnites have opportunities to engage in community-based
leadership experiences, allowing them to develop their leadership skills
while cultivating a heart for service.</p>
<h4>Tier 1 leadership - Cohort Experiences</h4>
<p>The Regent Leadership Programme, based on the 5 exemplary practices of
the Leadership Challenge, aims to equip our students with the knowledge
and competencies to be a Transformational Leader. The programme concludes
with a capstone class Values in Action (VIA) project for the students to
apply what they have learnt during the Leadership Programme.</p>
<p>The Leadership Programme is carried out from Sec 1 to Sec 3 and follows
the following structure:</p>
<p><strong><u>SEC 1: SELF-LEADERSHIP</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To help the Sec 1 students to make the transition to Secondary School,
the programme focuses on equipping the students with personal skills, focusing
on personal etiquette and time management skills, to teach our students
to be independent and responsible individuals. The Sec 1 Leadership Programme
also aims at imbuing in our students a basic understanding of the Five
Exemplary Practices of The Leadership Challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>SEC 2: PEER LEADERSHIP</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Building on the Sec 1 Leadership Programme, the Sec 2 Leadership Programme
provides opportunities for students to learn to work and collaborate in
teams effectively. One of the most important prerequisites of a good team
player is the ability to be an effective communicator. Thus, a key focus
of the programme is on public speaking and facilitation skills, which will
better prepare them for group and project work in and beyond the classroom.</p>
