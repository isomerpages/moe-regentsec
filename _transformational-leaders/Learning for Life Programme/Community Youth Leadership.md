<h4><strong>LEARNING FOR LIFE PROGRAMME (LLP)</strong></h4>
<p>Youths are the future leaders and changemakers of society. Guided by the
school’s mission of nurturing Transformational Leaders, the Learning for
Life Programme (LLP) - Community Youth Leadership (CYL) provides authentic
learning experiences to nurture student agents who are able to contribute
back to society based on their own interests and passions.</p>
<h4><strong>COMMUNITY YOUTH LEADERSHIP (CYL)</strong></h4>
<p>Through our LLP-CYL, Regent Secondary School aims to empower every Regenite
to be a responsible and transformational leader who is committed to excellence.
To realise every student's potential, every student is given the opportunity
to hone their leadership skills in either the classroom setting, CCAs,
or in the Student Council so that they can lead themselves, their peers,
and the community. Student Leaders @ Regent have opportunities to participate
in community-based leadership opportunities such as Post NDR dialogues
and North West Youth Assembly Programme – Young Leaders’ Camp.</p>

<h4><strong>VALUES-IN-ACTION (VIA)</strong></h4>
<p>Being a leader is nothing without contribution. Our CYL programmes aim
to develop student’s character, leadership and spirit for volunteering.
Beyond the leadership programmes, the CYL programme provides our students
with Values in Action (VIA) platforms and opportunities to take actions
to reach out and make a difference in the school and community. This is
done in a carefully scaffolded manner, culminating in student-initiated
class VIA projects in Sec 3 with the Sec 4 students serving as mentors
to them.</p>
<p>Regent student leaders are also able to strengthen their leadership competencies
through their contributions to the community such as through the North
West Community Development Council programmes (Care &amp; Repair, Silver
Care, Reduce @ North West, etc.) as well as engaging the seniors with the
Lions Befrienders and Methodist Welfare Services Home. Our student leaders
also take the initiative to organise other community initiatives such as
the Limbang Mid-Autumn Celebrations.</p>

<h4><strong>BUILDING CHARACTER AND AWARENESS</strong></h4>
<p>The Regent Leadership Programme, based on the 5 exemplary practices of
the Leadership Challenge, aims to equip our students with the knowledge
and competencies to be a Transformational Leader. The programme concludes
with a capstone class Values-in-Action (VIA) project for the students to
apply what they have learnt during the Leadership Programme.</p>
<p>The Leadership Programme is carried out from Sec 1 to Sec 3 and follows
the following structure:</p>
<p><strong>SEC 1 (SELF-LEADERSHIP): PERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS</strong>
</p>
<p><u>The Leadership Challenge Model alignment: Modelling the Way/Encouraging the Heart</u>
</p>
<p>To help the Sec 1 students to make the transition to Secondary School,
the programme focuses on equipping the students with personal skills, focusing
on personal etiquette and time management skills, to teach our students
to be independent and responsible individuals. The Sec 1 Leadership Programme
also aims at imbuing in our students a basic understanding of the Five
Exemplary Practices of The Leadership Challenge.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>SEC 2 (PEER LEADERSHIP): COMMUNICATION AND WORKING IN TEAMS</strong>
</p>
<p><u>The Leadership Challenge Model alignment: Enabling Others to Act</u>
</p>
<p>Building on the Sec 1 Leadership Programme, the Sec 2 Leadership Programme
provides opportunities for students to learn to work and collaborate in
teams effectively. One of the most important prerequisites of a good team
player is the ability to be an effective communicator. Thus, a key focus
of the programme is on public speaking and facilitation skills, which will
better prepare them for group and project work in and beyond the classroom.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>SEC 3 (THOUGHT LEADERSHIP): RESPONSIBLE DECISION-MAKING</strong>
</p>
<p><u>The Leadership Challenge Model alignment: Challenge the Process and Inspire a Shared Vision</u>
</p>
<p>Our Sec 3 students are the ones who will take up the mantle of leadership
in school, whether in their respective Co-Curricular Activities or in their
classes. The Sec 3 Leadership Programme focus on providing authentic scenarios
for students to clarify their leadership styles and decision-making so
that students will be better able to assume their leadership roles.</p>
