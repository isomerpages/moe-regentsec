#### **LEARNING FOR LIFE PROGRAMME (LLP)**

Youths are the future leaders and changemakers of society. Guided by the school’s mission of nurturing Transformational Leaders, the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - Community Youth Leadership (CYL) provides authentic learning experiences to nurture student agents who are able to contribute back to society based on their own interests and passions.   

#### **COMMUNITY YOUTH LEADERSHIP (CYL)**

Through our LLP-CYL, Regent Secondary School aims to empower every Regenite to be a responsible and transformational leader who is committed to excellence. To realise every student's potential, every student is given the opportunity to hone their leadership skills in either the classroom setting, CCAs, or in the Student Council so that they can lead themselves, their peers, and the community. Student Leaders @ Regent have opportunities to participate in community-based leadership opportunities such as Post NDR dialogues and North West Youth Assembly Programme – Young Leaders’ Camp.

#### **VALUES-IN-ACTION (VIA)**

Being a leader is nothing without contribution. Our CYL programmes aim to develop student’s character, leadership and spirit for volunteering. Beyond the leadership programmes,  the CYL programme provides our students with Values in Action (VIA) platforms and opportunities to take actions to reach out and make a difference in the school and community. This is done in a carefully scaffolded manner, culminating in student-initiated class VIA projects in Sec 3 with the Sec 4 students serving as mentors to them. 

Regent student leaders are also able to strengthen their leadership competencies through their contributions to the community such as through the North West Community Development Council programmes (Care &amp; Repair, Silver Care, Reduce @ North West, etc.) as well as engaging the seniors with the Lions Befrienders and Methodist Welfare Services Home. Our student leaders also take the initiative to organise other community initiatives such as the Limbang Mid-Autumn Celebrations.

#### **BUILDING CHARACTER AND AWARENESS**

The Regent Leadership Programme, based on the 5 exemplary practices of the Leadership Challenge, aims to equip our students with the knowledge and competencies to be a Transformational Leader. The programme concludes with a capstone class Values-in-Action (VIA) project for the students to apply what they have learnt during the Leadership Programme.   

The Leadership Programme is carried out from Sec 1 to Sec 3 and follows the following structure: 

**SEC 1 (SELF-LEADERSHIP): PERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS**

<u>The Leadership Challenge Model alignment: Modelling the Way/Encouraging the Heart</u>  

To help the Sec 1 students to make the transition to Secondary School, the programme focuses on equipping the students with personal skills, focusing on personal etiquette and time management skills, to teach our students to be independent and responsible individuals. The Sec 1 Leadership Programme also aims at imbuing in our students a basic understanding of the Five Exemplary Practices of The Leadership Challenge.

**SEC 2 (PEER LEADERSHIP): COMMUNICATION AND WORKING IN TEAMS**

<u>The Leadership Challenge Model alignment: Enabling Others to Act</u>  

Building on the Sec 1 Leadership Programme, the Sec 2 Leadership Programme provides opportunities for students to learn to work and collaborate in teams effectively. One of the most important prerequisites of a good team player is the ability to be an effective communicator. Thus, a key focus of the programme is on public speaking and facilitation skills, which will better prepare them for group and project work in and beyond the classroom.

**SEC 3 (THOUGHT LEADERSHIP): RESPONSIBLE DECISION-MAKING** 

<u>The Leadership Challenge Model alignment: Challenge the Process and Inspire a Shared Vision</u>  

Our Sec 3 students are the ones who will take up the mantle of leadership in school, whether in their respective Co-Curricular Activities or in their classes. The Sec 3 Leadership Programme focus on providing authentic scenarios for students to clarify their leadership styles and decision-making so that students will be better able to assume their leadership roles.
