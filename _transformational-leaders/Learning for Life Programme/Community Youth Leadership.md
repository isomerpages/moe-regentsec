Community Youth Leadership
==========================

Youths are regarded as the future leaders of society as they possess enormous and multi-dimensional talents and creative abilities which can moulded and harnessed in a conducive atmosphere. At Regent, our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is on Community Youth Leadership (CYL). Guided by the school’s vision and mission, the LLP is undergirded by a real-world experience learning pedagogy. We believe that every students can be developed as a leader. The CYL programmes aim to develop student’s character, leadership and spirit for volunteering to become a responsible and confident leader who is committed to excellence. This is achieved through our school’s Student Leadership Programme and the Values-in-Action Programme.

The Student Leadership programme equips our students with the attitude, knowledge and Communication, Action Management and Facilitation skills in either the classroom setting, the CCA or in the Student Council to lead self, peers and community. The Values-in-Action (VIA) programme provides our students with the platforms and opportunities to take action to reach out and make a difference in the school and community.These include cohort-wide programmes to develop the students’ understanding of leadership principles and communication skills to equip them to become confident leaders who are able to lead themselves and others:

The Head, Heart and Hands process is adopted to provide students with opportunities to develop their leadership potential and cater to students’ needs, interests and talents. The ‘Head’ element provides formal, informal and service-learning training for all students. In 2019, Student Leaders have participated in Hwa Chong Integrated Leadership Boarding Programme, Leadership Training Camp @ Keat Hong and North West Youth Assembly Programme – Young Leaders’ Camp. The ‘Hands’ element provides students with the opportunities in both instructional and co-curricular programmes so that students can gain experience in leading others. For example, students are involved in the North West Community Development programmes such as Care & Repair, Silver Care and Reduce @ North West programmes as well as engaging the seniors in the Lions Befrienders and the Fei Yue Senior Activity Centre. The ‘Heart’ element seeks to provide feedback to students on their leadership development and enables them to reflect deeply on their role as leaders.
