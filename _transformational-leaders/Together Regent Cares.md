## **Together Regent Cares 2022**

Each time we sing the lines in the chorus of our National Anthem, “Majulah Singapura”, we are filled with a strong sense of patriotism and hope for Singapore. The theme for this year’s National Day, “Stronger Together, Majulah” aptly brought out the spirit of the nation as we commemorated the event on 8 August 2022. “Stronger Together” reminds Singaporeans that unity in our diversity is what makes us stronger, whereas “majulah”, which means “onward”, encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our independence 57 years ago.

The day started off majestically at the parade square as the school gathered for the Observance Ceremony. Our sharp-looking Uniformed Group cadets were already in formation, representing the fortitude of Singapore. The Concert Band alleviated our pride during the singing of national anthem as we sang along to their live performance. As the students recited the “Recollections” and chanted refrains like “We pledge to keep our nation free, with justice and equality”, we solidified the pledge that the future is in our hands, and we should not take our independence for granted. Our strong emotions continued to soar as Show Choir led us in the singing of “My Nation, My Home.”

During the national day lesson, students had a chance to reflect on their experience of living through the pandemic and make a commitment on how they could contribute to a future they envision for Singapore by submitting their digital pledge. The future of Singapore is also dependent on our international relationships and Singapore is one of the founding countries of ASEAN. Since 8 August happened to be ASEAN Day, NE Ambassadors led their classes in a Kahoot activity to remind students of the role ASEAN plays for the nation.

In the last segment, the school gathered once again in the hall for the concert item. We were greatly entertained with a live drama programme entitled, “Pieces of You, Pieces of Me” by Interaction Arts and Drama Network. Through the character, Sam, students were reminded of the critical role they play in preserving our nation’s heritage and defending the nation.

To see our dreams come alive, the National Day edition of Regent Rave gave us the chance to hear our students share their well-wishes for Singapore. We were inspired to be stronger together and take actions for our beloved country. Hence, it was momentous for the school to rejoice the culmination of “Together Regent Care,” in which every member of Regent family contributed goody bags for our partners in the community as well the support staff in our school.

The day ended in a high note as we were once again serenaded by Regent Pop Band who performed some of our favourite National Day melodies. Show Choir students once again led the school in the singing of community songs as we expressed our love and joy for Singapore.

All in all, Regent Secondary School would like to wish Singapore a Happy 57th birthday and we are proud and exhilarated to celebrate this significant day with the nation!
