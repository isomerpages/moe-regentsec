<p>The school is a place where students value strong friendships. Positive
peer relationships facilitate the provision of care and a sense of belonging
amongst students. Such relationships can also be powerful channels of positive
influenceâ€”just take a look at our Peer Support Leaders (PSL)!</p>
<p>Every class has at least 2 PSLs who are trained in the three domains of
peer support and relationships: peer bonding, peer helping and peer influencing.
PSLs also attend rich experiences like Dialogue in the Dark to develop
their sense of empathy for others.</p>
<p>Apart from regularly organising peer bonding facilities to foster strong
relationships in the classrooms, PSLs embark on projects to encourage their
classmates to have strong webs of friendships. Such projects include promoting
kindness as part of Regent Kindness Movement, friendships as part of Social
Defence during Total Defence Day as well as promoting self-care during
the examination period. PSLs are also trained to look out and support their
peers who may require more social resources.</p>
<p>In Regent, every student is a peer supporter. Our PSLs proudly lead their
peers to create a strong and supporting learning environment in the classrooms
and beyond!</p>
