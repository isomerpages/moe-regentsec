<p>During the first week of school in January 2025, Regent Secondary School
welcomed our newly minted Secondary One students into our midst. With a
specially curated Orientation program designed to help break the ice and
ease them into the new environment, the Secondary One students participated
in a range of activities led by Student Councillors, as new inductees into
the Regent Family.</p>
<p>Across the four days, the students blossomed from shy and quiet individuals
into confident young ladies and gentlemen as they discovered more about
the school and classmates through activities such as the mass games and
Amazing Race around the school. Despite their initial shyness, many rose
to the occasion and displayed impressive resilience in completing the challenges
throughout the orientation.</p>
<p>To end the Orientation with aplomb, the Secondary Ones showcased their
class cheers and dances in front of their parents and teachers and finished
with a rousing rendition of the school song. The pouring rain did not dampen
their spirits and just like the fire that was ignited that night, we hope
that all the Secondary One Regenites will continue living out our PRIDE
values and blaze forth to glory as they start their new journey here.</p>
