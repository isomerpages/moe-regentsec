<p><strong><u>Secondary 1 Orientation Programme 2026: A Joyful Beginning</u></strong>
</p>
<p>From 2 to 9 January, Regent Secondary School buzzed with excitement and
youthful energy as our Secondary 1 students took part in the Secondary
1 Orientation Programme 2026. Carefully designed to support a smooth transition
into secondary school life, the programme provided a meaningful and memorable
start to their journey at the school.</p>
<p>This year’s orientation centred on the theme of Class Values, encouraging
students to reflect on the qualities that would guide them throughout their
secondary school years. Orientation Group Leaders thoughtfully selected
movies that embodied their respective class values, using familiar stories
and characters to spark discussion and connection. Through these shared
experiences, students explored values such as resilience, teamwork, kindness
and perseverance, while forming early bonds with their classmates in a
relaxed and engaging setting.</p>
<p>A key highlight of the programme was the Amazing Race, where students
worked together to complete a series of challenges around the school. These
activities tested not only their problem-solving skills, but also their
ability to communicate, cooperate and support one another. It was heartening
to see students encouraging their peers and celebrating small successes
as a class.</p>
<p>The energy continued during the Mass Games, where coordinated movements
and spirited cheering fostered a strong sense of unity and school pride.
The programme concluded on a high note with a lively Campfire Night, as
classes showcased their creativity and class spirit through performances,
cheers and skits.</p>
<p>Overall, the Secondary 1 Orientation Programme was a resounding success,
laying a strong foundation for friendships, confidence and a shared sense
of belonging as students begin their secondary school journey.</p>
