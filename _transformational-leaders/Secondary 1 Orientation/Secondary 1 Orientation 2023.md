<p>A blazing start to the year.</p><p>We welcome our Regenites back to school, including our Sec 1 students to the Regent Family.</p><p>The Sec 1 students had the opportunity to discover more about the teachers, their classmates and the school through a series of games and activities. The week-long orientation ended with a campfire and student performances, &nbsp;a Regent tradition where we invite parents to witness their childâ€™s initiation and transition to Secondary School.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Sec%201%20Orientation/S1Orient2023-1A.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Sec%201%20Orientation/S1Orient2023-2A.jpg"></div><p></p>
