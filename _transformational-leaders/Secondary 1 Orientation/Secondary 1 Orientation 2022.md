Start the year bright

Start the day right

We welcome our Regenites back to school, including our Sec 1 students, the new additions to our Regent Family. The Sec 1 students will be undergoing a week-long orientation programme, where they will have the opportunity to learn more about the school and each other through a series of games and activities They will also have the opportunity to reflect on what being a Regenite means for them.
