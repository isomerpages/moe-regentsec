The Polytechnic Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) allows students to apply for and receive conditional offers for admission prior to their GCE O-Level Examinations. Students applying through the Poly EAE are considered for admission on the basis of demonstrated aptitude and interest, beyond just  
academic grades.

In Regent Secondary, the EAE programme serves as a platform to encapsulate the schoolâ€™s 4-D (Discover, Decide, Develop, Dream) approach to education and career guidance. Secondary 4 Express (4E) and Secondary 5 Normal Academic (5N) students are provided guidance in their EAE application.

In 2021, 82% of 4E5N students who applied for EAE are selected for interviews, with 47% of the  
students offered a course of study through EAE.
