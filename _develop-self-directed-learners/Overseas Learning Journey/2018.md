## Xiamen, China

### 5-9 November 2018 

The learning journey to Xiamen allowed our students to work together and interact with youths from a different country. Not only did they get to experience the lifestyle of the Chinese in Xiamen, they also appreciated the history and culture of the places of interest visited.

**Day 1:**

**Visit to Lianhua Middle School**

**_“At Lianhua Middle School, we learnt about the history of Xiamen, Min Nan proverbs and poetry._**  
**_We had a great time interacting with the Chinese students as we performed songs & dances for one another and we exchanged gifts too.” – Eng Guo An 3-5_**

**Day 2:** 

**Visit to Gulangyu Islet, Shuzhuang Garden and Pottery DIY**

**_“I was impressed by how well Shuzhuang Garden is maintained and has both Eastern & Western elements to make it a scenic hit amongst tourists. As for our hands-on experience at pottery-making, I found the activity to be very therapeutic and relaxing. It taught us to be patient and to improve our level of concentration.” – Nadhirah 3-3_**

**Day 3:**

**Hakka Earth Building“The Legend of Minnan” Show**  

**_“Studying the architecture and history of Hakka earth building was truly an eye-opening experience for us. It is fascinating how the structure managed to defend its people from intruders. Later it was also a treat for our eyes to watch the ‘Legend of Minnan’ show. We were amazed by the 360-degree revolving stage and the use of 3-dimensional effects, with real actors and virtual scenes. ” – Manoj 3-1_**
