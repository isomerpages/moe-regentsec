As Regent celebrated Singapore’s 58th birthday, we reflected upon this year’s national day theme, “Onward As One”, which calls upon Singaporeans to look forward confidently while moving onward together in building our shared future as one united people.

The day started off magnificently at the parade square as the school gathered for the Observance Ceremony. The marching of our Uniformed Group cadets symbolically exemplified the notion of Regenites "moving onward as one. The Concert Band kept our spirits high with their live performance, especially as we came together “as one” while singing the national anthem and reciting the “Recollections.”  Show Choir’s melodic singing of “My Nation, My Home” raised our determination to rise above all challenges that lie ahead.

During CCE lesson, the lower secondary students had a chance to reflect upon the importance of our day-to-day interactions in building a sense of belonging while the upper secondary students pondered upon our strengths and areas for improvements in building inclusivity and unity in Singapore. The lessons impressed upon the importance of playing our part in moving onward as one.

After the CCE lesson, the school gathered once again in the hall for the National Day Celebration, where we relished the enjoyable performance put up by our Regent Pop Band as well as the Show Choir. We also looked back fondly at the various leadership and community outreach programmes which allowed us to give back to the community. It was uplifting to hear from our lower secondary students what they love about Singapore in the Regent Rave National Day segment. The concert ended on a high note as Regenites took part in a lively gameshow “Do Not Forget the Lyrics – National Day Edition.” The whole school was reverberating in joy while singing in unison to our favourite national day songs, led by Show Choir members and some of our beloved teachers!
