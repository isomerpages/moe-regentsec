<p>On 23 July 2022, our Environmental Sciences Club and Modern Dance had
the opportunity to participate in the Limbang PAssionArts Festival 2022.
Environmental Sciences Club set up a Green Booth where our students shared
their knowledge on environmental conservation with the community and our
dance group showcased their talents through a modern dance performance.</p>
<p>At the Green Booth, members of the public had the opportunity to participate
in simple upcycling tasks, where they can turn their common household waste
into something useful. They had a choice between using toilet rolls and
making it into a pillow box or a paper dinosaur or using old magazines
and turning it into a paper bag. Participants can then decorate their items
and further personalise it. It was a meaningful and memorable experience
for our students as it was their first time sharing upcycling tips with
members of the public in a face-to-face event.</p>
<p>Jaime Pat (1-Detemination) reflected that at first, she and her peers
felt a little hesitant to interact with the public. But with the help of
their seniors, they quickly warmed up to the public. It felt amazing to
educate people about what they can do with their common household waste
instead of just discarding them. Through this meaningful experience at
the Limbang PAssionArts festival, Jaime and her friends had become more
confident in interacting with the others. If there was ever another chance
to participate in an event like this, she would definitely volunteer to
take part again!</p>
<p>Marion Tye (3-Gratitude) also shared that from this event, he has learnt
to step out of his comfort zone and communicate confidently with others.
It was not easy at first, however, he took a leap of faith and started
to be more confident in facilitating others to work on the upcycling tasks.</p>
<p>Thank you Limbang for this opportunity for our students to contribute
to the community!</p>
