<p>Our Secondary Three Principles of Accounts (POA) students recently embarked
on a learning journey to two popular shopping malls in Jurong, JEM and
Westgate. The trip offered students a first-hand encounter with real-world
applications of Accounting principles, enriching their understanding of
concepts learnt in a tangible manner.</p>

<p>In groups, our students navigated the bustling corridors of the malls,
visiting an array of shops and interacting with retailers to glean insights
about running a business. One focal point of their exploration was the
vibrant trading sector, exemplified by well-known establishments like Foot
Locker and IKEA. Here, students observed the intricate dynamics of trading
businesses in action. They learned more about how these companies procure
goods from manufacturers and wholesalers and subsequently sell them to
consumers at a profit. Moreover, they gained valuable insights into inventory
management techniques and strategies for enhancing revenue through attractive
discount offers for shoppers.</p>
<p>Students also popped by a hair salon and an orthopaedic clinic to learn
more about the distinctive nature of service-oriented enterprises. Through
these encounters, students grasped the fundamental difference between goods
and service sectors—that service businesses offer consumers intangible
experiences rather than physical commodities. Further, they learnt about
the types of non-current assets that service-based ventures own—like furniture,
benches, and mirrors in a hair salon—which serve to facilitate operational
efficacy.</p>
<p>All in all, the excursion to JEM and Westgate was an enriching experience
that allowed our POA students to extend their learning beyond the classroom.
The invaluable insights gleaned through this learning journey will no doubt
be useful for their future academic pursuits and professional endeavours
in the realm of accounting.</p>
