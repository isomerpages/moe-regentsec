<h4>Teaching Reimagined: Regent Showcases VR-Powered Classrooms at TCEF 2025</h4>
<p>A team of passionate educators from Regent Secondary School proudly represented
the school at the Teachers’ Conference and ExCEL Fest 2025 (TCEF2025),
a biennial event organised by the Ministry of Education to support professional
learning and educational innovation.</p>
<p>Their presentation, titled Immersive Learning Redefined: The Power of
VR in Boosting Student Engagement, highlighted how Virtual Reality (VR)
can transform classroom experiences. The team shared how the use of VR
goggles has opened new pathways to deepen student engagement—not just cognitively,
but also emotionally—leading to greater motivation and stronger acquisition
of concepts and skills.</p>

<p>What made the presentation especially compelling was its breadth. Drawing
on case studies from English, Mother Tongue Languages, Geography, and History,
the teachers demonstrated how VR could be meaningfully integrated into
disciplinary learning. Whether it was using VR to visualise abstract geographical
processes or spark idea generation in language learning, the results were
consistent: students were more actively involved and invested in their
learning.</p>

<p>The session concluded with a lively hands-on component, where educators
got the chance to don VR goggles and experience immersive learning firsthand.
Laughter, excitement, and curiosity filled the room as participants navigated
through virtual environments, engaging their senses and imaginations.</p>
<p>The event was a proud moment for Regent, offering our teachers a national
platform to share pedagogical innovations and connect with fellow educators.
It was also a celebration of collaboration across departments—showing just
what’s possible when we come together to rethink teaching for the future.</p>
<p>Go Team Regent!</p>
