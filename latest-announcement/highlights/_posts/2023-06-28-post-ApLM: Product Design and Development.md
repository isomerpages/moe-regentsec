<p>The third week of the June holidays is an enriching one for fellow students.
A group of Secondary 3 Regenites attended a 3-day Applied Learning Module
(ApLM) for Product Design and Development organised by the Singapore Polytechnic,
where they learn a variety of skills, ranging from basic product design
knowledge to idea generation and presentation techniques.</p>
<p>On the first day, students were introduced to the process of product design
and development. In addition, students learnt to utilise sketching techniques
to effectively present their ideas. Thereafter, students were challenged
to re-imagine and redesign a series of alarm clocks as part of their coursework
for the Design Project.</p>
<p>The next day, students were taught how they could use Adobe Photoshop
to create their marketing posters. Through this, students learnt about
the importance of aesthetic appeal for their target audience.</p>
<p>On the final day, our students busied themselves with the preparation
of their presentation slides and added the necessary finishing touches
to their design.</p>
<p>Student Wee Jun Kai Lucius from 3-Integrity remarked, “I have gained insightful
knowledge from this module and that has completely altered my perspective
of the course. Other than learning about various research techniques, I
also refined my writing and presentation abilities and developed a stronger
sense of self-discipline and time management. These transferable skills
will definitely benefit me in the future.”</p>
<p>Overall, our students enjoyed the module immensely. We believe this journey
not only broadened our students' horizons but also nurtured their passion
for product design, and ignited the spark of innovation within them.</p>
