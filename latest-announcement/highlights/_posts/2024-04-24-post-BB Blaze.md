<p>Cadets from the Boys’ Brigade (BB) took part in BB Blaze, a fitness and
adventure competition cum endurance race on 6 April. The boys embarked
on a formidable journey spanning 20 kilometres across Singapore, completing
an array of physical challenges incorporating sports such as archery and
kayaking, as well as a demanding obstacle course that saw them scaling
over high walls and cargo nets. Participants were also assessed on their
First Aid and micro-navigation skills—core components of the BB badgework
curriculum.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that our team comprising Officer Shaun Kok
and cadets Keith Ang (4-Pride), Carvel Chua (4-Respect), and Ip Seng Choo
(2-Determination) clinched the Championship title in the BB Blaze (Open
Category)! We are proud of the indomitable spirit displayed by all cadets
who participated in this challenge, which has no doubt been a thrilling
and meaningful one. As winner Seng Choo notes, ‘While the weather was scorching
and the race was arduous, the experience was immensely fulfilling for me.
I was able to bond with my seniors, discover more of Singapore’s charms,
and engage in thrilling activities such as kayaking, archery, and high
elements. Being pitted against fellow BB participants from various other
institutions fueled my motivation. The event was an absolute blast, especially
since I helped my team secure first place in the open category, making
all our sacrifices worthwhile.’</p>
<p>Congratulations to the 91<sup>st</sup> Company on your wonderful achievements!</p>
