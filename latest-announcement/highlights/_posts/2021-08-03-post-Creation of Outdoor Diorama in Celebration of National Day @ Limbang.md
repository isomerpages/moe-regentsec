<p>Regent Secondary School is excited to partner with the community to celebrate
this yearâ€™s National Day. The members of Design and Innovation Club and
Environmental Science Club were chosen to create an outdoor diorama to
represent the old and new Singapore. The key theme on the juxtaposition
of the old and new showcases features such as on transportation where old
modes of transport involving sampans, bumboats and rickshaw are juxtaposed
against the modern MRT and aeroplanes&nbsp;represented by Changi Airport.
Despite the many challenges posed by the pandemic, the students persevered
to complete it.</p>

<p>Using the skills taught in Design Thinking and Model Making, the students
brainstormed for ideas of what would best represent the old Singapore which
they were not familiar with. They decided on the dragon playground in old
Toa Payoh as it was a favourite place for many children of different races
to play together and form strong bonds. Another idea was based on the godowns
along Singapore River as this was where our trading past paved the road
for Singapore to become one of the freest port in the world and a champion
of free trade. The Marina Bay superstructure and the Supertrees are chosen
to represent the new Singapore as they give Singaporeans a strong sense
of pride in our achievements.</p>

<p>This project has helped to give the students a better appreciation of
the country. The hard work put in by them mirrors the toils of the pioneer
generations which have benefited them today. The beautiful diorama exceeded
their own expectations and we hope it would make the community celebration
of National Day more enriching.</p>
<p>Majulah Singapore!</p>
