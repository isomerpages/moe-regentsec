<p>We bade farewell to the holy month of Ramadan and ushered in the month
of Syawal with our Hari Raya Aidilfitri Concert on 18 April 2023.</p>
<p>Themed “Cahaya Aidilfitri” (Light of Aidilfitri), the Concert saw our
student talents putting up a series of performances to showcase the rich
cultural and religious traditions of the Malay-Muslim community in Singapore.
There were dance performances by our Malay Language students as well as
a show-stopping Silat display; our English Drama club also performed a
sketch to illustrate the significance that the holy month holds for Muslims
across the world. In keeping with the festivities, Regenites were also
treated to a musical performance by the Regent Pop Band, who performed
a selection of Raya songs old and new.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was heartening to see all students and staff coming together
as one to celebrate Eid with joy and thanksgiving!</p>
