Traditionally, Mid-Autumn and mooncakes were associated with Chinese folklores. However, in Singapore, Mid-Autumn symbolises much more than that. This joyous represents unity among our people as we come together to celebrate our differences. 
 
On the 23rd of September, Regent Secondary School celebrated Mid-Autumn with our Limbang neighbourhood. Held at Limbang Park, our student leaders, Modern Dance CCA, and English Drama CCA conducted various performances and set up activity booths to bring joy and laughter to Limbang’s cosy neighbourhood. 
 
Our Modern Dance students stirred up a storm both onstage and offstage, a testament to the power of their movements and expressions. Our English Drama students presented a play on the tragic love story of Chang’e and Houyi, and for a brief moment, the stage became a moment where emotions resonated with the drama’s poignant conclusion. Booth adorned with a kaleidoscope of colours were thoughtfully put up by our student leaders, and people of all ages were drawn to these booths, delighted by the various activities offered. 
 
Ivy Phanada, a student from English Drama CCA remarked, “I felt I sense of fulfilment as I was able to learn new skills. The sense of satisfaction in bringing joy to the people around us was worth all the time and effort that we have invested.” 
 
Student leader Lee Zi Yan, Jodie also said, “I absolutely loved every minute of the festival. It was lovely seeing the little kids trying to figure out the rules to the games and I was glad to see adults enjoying themselves too. I would definitely do it again if given the chance next year.” 
 
We hope that the glow of the bright full moon had lit everyone’s way to happiness and prosperity!
