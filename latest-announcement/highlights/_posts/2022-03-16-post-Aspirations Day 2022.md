<p>Walt Disney once said, ‘All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage
to pursue them.’ Indeed, our Secondary Four and Five students took a step
closer towards pursuing their aspirations with the exciting array of industry
and career talks on Regent’s Aspirations Day, held recently on 16 March
2022!</p>
<p>We were privileged to have staff from Nanyang Polytechnic speak to our
students about the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) and Early Admissions
Exercise (EAE). The sharing enlightened students on the post-secondary
educational pathways available to them, and ignited their motivation to
pursue their dream courses, including Kerynn Toh (4-Integrity), who took
away from the session useful tips on crafting her EAE application and write-up.</p>
<p>The latter half of the day saw distinguished guests from fields as diverse
as Hospitality and Tourism, Biomedical Science, and Media and Design and
more giving students a peek into their daily routines at work, as well
as sharing with them a wealth of personal experiences and invaluable nuggets
of wisdom. Our keynote speaker, Dr Vincent Pang, Assistant Professor and
Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research
(CIDER), spoke candidly about a contemporary career landscape in which
change is the only constant, and reminded our students to embrace a future
of lifelong learning. This was a sentiment echoed by Tan Hui Xuan (4-Integrity),
who shared, ‘I have learnt that people constantly need to innovate in order
to succeed in their jobs. This is especially so for the Food &amp; Beverage
industry, where passion, creativity, and a thirst for knowledge are essential
for businesses to prosper and stay on top of the competition!’</p>
<p>We hope that Aspirations Day has truly inspired our Regenites to go forth
and pursue their dreams with courage! Our students can continue to look
forward to a host of course-related talks planned for them this April!</p>
