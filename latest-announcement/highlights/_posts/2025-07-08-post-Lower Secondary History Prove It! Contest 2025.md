<p>This year, two enthusiastic teams of lower secondary students proudly
represented Regent Secondary School in the Prove It! Contest 2025—a prestigious
national competition organised by the National Library Board (NLB), supported
by MOE and RICE Media. Centred on the theme “Singapore’s green future:
How can teenagers create maximum impact in promoting sustainability via
digital tools?”, the competition challenged participants to explore pressing
climate issues while honing their information literacy and digital communication
skills.</p>
<p>Comprising Secondary One and Two students, the Regent teams displayed
remarkable commitment throughout their journey. They conducted in-depth
research using credible online and library sources, surveyed their peers,
and produced a compelling 600-word article supported by visuals and citations.
As part of their submission, students also scripted, filmed, and edited
a dynamic 90-second video newsreel to bring their message to life.</p>
<p>One of the highlights came when the Secondary Two team had the opportunity
to share their video with the entire school during a morning Zoom assembly—an
inspiring moment of student-led advocacy in action.</p>

<p>Josephine, one of the participants, shared, “Working on this project was
challenging but fulfilling. We had to meet regularly to brainstorm, research,
and divide the tasks fairly so that everyone had a role to play.” Her teammate
Mirdhula added, “If you find yourself in a tough situation, don’t worry!
Teamwork, clear communication, and using reliable sources can really help.”</p>
<p>Their participation in Prove It! 2025 reflects Regent’s strong commitment
to nurturing responsible, informed, and future-ready learners—empowered
to make a real difference.</p>
