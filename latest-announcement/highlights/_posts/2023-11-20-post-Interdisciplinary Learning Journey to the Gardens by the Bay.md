An exciting day of learning at Gardens by the Bay!
 
On 26 October, our Secondary Two students headed down to Gardens by the Bay for a day of learning and exploration. There, they competed against 9 other schools in a Race to Sustainability. Students explored the Gardens to look for clues and answers to an online activity sheet, which helped to instill a better appreciation of Gardens by the Bay’s conservation and sustainability efforts to combat climate change. The Race tied in closely with the aims of our Secondary Two Science curriculum, which has a running emphasis on the impact of human actions on the environment.
 
Students were also able to apply what they have learnt in Mathematics at the Gardens! With a measuring tape in hand, they were tasked to complete problems that involved taking measurements and calculations around the Gardens. This hands-on activity allowed students to appreciate how Mathematics can be used in real-world scenarios.
 
They were also able to apply literacy and writing skills acquired in their Mother Tongue classes in crafting a short write-up to describe their experience at Gardens by the Bay.
 
All in all, our Regenites had an enriching learning experience at the various conservatories at Gardens by the Bay, and were able to see how their knowledge can be well-utilised in real world contexts.
