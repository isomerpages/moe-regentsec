<p>Learning Mother Tongue Languages in Regent is more than just about words,
vocabulary, grammar and sentence construction – it is also about the appreciation
of the rich culture, traditions and heritage of the students’ Mother Tongue.</p>
<p>MT Fortnight in Regent is a valuable learning opportunity where Regenites
are immersed in the appreciation and learning of their Mother Tongue languages
and culture through diversified activities. Some of the authentic cultural
activities carried out this year are Chinese Paper Cutting, Shadow Puppetry,
Latern Making as well as Wau Kite, Silat, Zapin Dance, Bunga Rampai and
Indian Thoranam.</p>
<p>These activities have provided authentic opportunities for students to
experience the various culture and heritage. Well done to all the participants
of the MT Fortnight and to the Mother Tongue Department for such an engaging
and educational exhibition of culture!</p>
