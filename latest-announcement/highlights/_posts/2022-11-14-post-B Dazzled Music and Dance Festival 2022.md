On 6 November 2022, our Regent Revolution Show Choir took to the stage at the B-Dazzled Music & Dance Festival where they attained the Diamond Award and Best Showmanship Award!

Performing two songs from the hit musical, _Matilda_—‘When I Grow Up’ and ‘Revolting Children’—our Show Choir members sang and danced with gusto in a spectacular showcase that earned them plaudits from the judges and audience. In the words of Colin Powell, ‘There are no secrets to success. It is the result of preparation, hard work, and learning from failure.’ Truly, our Show Choir’s glittering performance is testament to the determination and dedication of its members, teachers, and instructors, and we are proud of how the Choir has stepped up to the challenge to deliver a night to remember. Blaze Forth to Glory, and may we continue to soar to ever greater heights!
