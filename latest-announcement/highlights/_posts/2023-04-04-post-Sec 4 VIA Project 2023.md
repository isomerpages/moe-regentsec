<p>In 2023, 4-Pride and 4-Respect reached out to the elderly at Ang Mo Kio
Family Service Centre as part of their Secondary Three Values-in-Action
(VIA) projects. This year, their juniors, the current Secondary Three students
will be about to embark on the same journey themselves!</p>
<p>Therefore, the 4-Pride and 4-Respect students took this opportunity to
share their experiences with their juniors. 4-Pride shared about their
project planning process, as well as the challenges that the class faced.
On the other hand, 4-Respect created a poster and conducted role-plays
to showcase tips on interacting with the elderly.</p>
<p>Ian Yap Hao Yi, VIA Representative of 4-Respect said, “<em>It was a daunting task to oversee the presentation. I felt satisfied that the role-plays entertained the Secondary Three students. I am glad that they were able to learn more about the ways to better interact with the elderly through our presentation. Overall, I feel that I have grown as a leader.</em>”</p>

<p>Similarly, Nurlydia Binte Mohammad, VIA Representative of 4-Pride commented
that organising the VIA project was a daunting but fulfilling task. “Even
though the process was not easy, I have learnt to work with others. I have
also picked up presentation skills along the way. I am proud that my class
received positive feedback from the audience.”</p>

<p>As Seth Godin once said, "Transformational leaders don't start by denying
the world around them. Instead, they describe a future they'd like to create."
We believe this sharing will guide the Secondary Three students well as
they embark on their journey to improve the lives of others. Blaze forth
