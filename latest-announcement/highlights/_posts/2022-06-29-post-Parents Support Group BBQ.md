<p>About 100 Parent Support Group (PSG) members, students and staff of Regent
Secondary School gathered at the school canteen on 25 June 2022 for the
first face-to-face event since the COVID-19 pandemic - the eagerly awaited&nbsp;BBQ!</p>

<p>The&nbsp;PSG&nbsp;EXCO had spent time preparing the food lists, bonding
activities,&nbsp;BBQ&nbsp;set-up and the invite messages for the various
parent chat groups to ensure an interesting line-up of activities for all.</p>
<p>There was much enthusiasm as&nbsp;PSG&nbsp;members started trickling in
at 5pm, with their family members in tow. Our Principal, Mr Leong, welcomed
them warmly and shared the school’s focus with them. Things got “heated
up” as the smoky aroma of charcoal filled the air and an appetizing spread
of food was laid out for the guests. They were also entertained by lively
music and interesting ice-breakers and games, helmed by the&nbsp;PSG&nbsp;EXCO.</p>
<p>It was indeed a relaxing time of bonding with family members and with
one another. The evening culminated with a family photo of all present
at the school parade square and 3 cheers.</p>
<p>We look forward to the next bonding session!</p>
