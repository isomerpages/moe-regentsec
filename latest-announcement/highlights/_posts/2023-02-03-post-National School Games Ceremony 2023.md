On 3 February 2023, our school held a National School Games (NSG) Ceremony for our student athletes who are participating in the NSG tournament this year.

Amidst deafening applause, representatives from our Sports and Games CCAs, namely Badminton, Basketball, Football, Netball and Taekwondo, walked down the centre aisle of the school hall with great pride and honour.

The highlight of the ceremony focused on the motto, “Character in Sporting Excellence”, where our Sports and Games CCA Leader, Emily Cheu from 4-Integrity led the student athletes to recite the Athletes’ oath as a reminder to uphold the virtues of sportsmanship in the tournament.

The ceremony culminated with the presentation of the school jerseys by our Principal, Mrs Sng, to the captains of each team. The jersey presentation symbolises our school values of Passion, Respect, Integrity, Determination and Empathy (P.R.I.D.E.), which our student athletes will embody as they don the school colours for each game.

We would like to wish our Sports and Games CCAs the very best as they compete in this year’s National School Games. May they “Blaze Forth To Glory”!
