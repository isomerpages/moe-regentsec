### **Sec 4 & 5 Sports Fiesta (Ultimate Frisbee)**

Our graduating cohort had their Sports Fiesta (Ultimate Frisbee) tournament on 30 June 2023 before they swing into full preparation for their national examinations. Through this inter-class tournament, students had the opportunity to apply the Ultimate skills that they have learnt during the PE lessons. 4-Pride was awarded the Overall Class Champion. Qaysh Matin from 4-Determination and Yuki Khoo from 4-Empathy both won the Best Sportsmanship awards. 
 
A special shoutout to the Regent PE department and Sec 3 CCA leaders for the wonderfully-organised event! A big round of applause for our Sec 4 & 5 students for the exemplary display of resilience and sportsmanship as well as putting their best effort for this tournament!
