Earth Day was commemorated globally on the 22nd of April. To kickstart the commemoration in Regent, students from the Environmental Science Club shared with their peers during Morning Assembly on the need to protect our Earth. Aligning to this year’s theme on Food Sustainability, they also shared on how we can build our food resilience. 

Back in class, the Environment Champions shared a video on ways to practise the 3Rs at home. They further shared ways to reduce food wastage such as ordering only what you need and they encouraged good recycling habits among their peers by setting up a class recycling corner in the class. Chew Cai Ling from 2-Empathy shared that she has learnt not to be picky when choosing fruits or vegetables as “ugly” fruit does not mean that the quality of the food is poor.

Students also visited the booths set up at the canteen and attempted the SLS lessons on Food Sustainability to find out more on how they can take actions to protect the Earth.
