<p>Each time we sing the lines in the chorus of our National Anthem, “Majulah
Singapura”, we are filled with a strong sense of patriotism and hope for
Singapore. The theme for this year’s National Day, “Stronger Together,
Majulah” aptly brought out the spirit of the nation as we commemorated
the event on 8 August 2022. “Stronger Together” reminds Singaporeans that
unity in our diversity is what makes us stronger, whereas “majulah”, which
means “onward”, encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our
independence 57 years ago.</p>
<p>The day started off majestically at the parade square as the school gathered
for the Observance Ceremony. Our sharp-looking Uniformed Group cadets were
already in formation, representing the fortitude of Singapore. The Concert
Band alleviated our pride during the singing of national anthem as we sang
along to their live performance. As the students recited the “Recollections”
and chanted refrains like “We pledge to keep our nation free, with justice
and equality”, we solidified the pledge that the future is in our hands,
and we should not take our independence for granted. Our strong emotions
continued to soar as Show Choir led us in the singing of “My Nation, My
Home.”</p>
<p>During the national day lesson, students had a chance to reflect on their
experience of living through the pandemic and make a commitment on how
they could contribute to a future they envision for Singapore by submitting
their digital pledge. The future of Singapore is also dependent on our
international relationships and Singapore is one of the founding countries
of ASEAN. Since 8 August happened to be ASEAN Day, NE Ambassadors led their
classes in a Kahoot activity to remind students of the role ASEAN plays
for the nation.</p>
<p>In the last segment, the school gathered once again in the hall for the
concert item. We were greatly entertained with a live drama programme entitled,
“Pieces of You, Pieces of Me” by Interaction Arts and Drama Network. Through
the character, Sam, students were reminded of the critical role they play
in preserving our nation’s heritage and defending the nation.</p>
<p>To see our dreams come alive, the National Day edition of Regent Rave
gave us the chance to hear our students share their well-wishes for Singapore.
We were inspired to be stronger together and take actions for our beloved
country. Hence, it was momentous for the school to rejoice the culmination
of “Together Regent Care,” in which every member of Regent family contributed
goody bags for our partners in the community as well the support staff
in our school.</p>
<p>The day ended in a high note as we were once again serenaded by Regent
Pop Band who performed some of our favourite National Day melodies. Show
Choir students once again led the school in the singing of community songs
as we expressed our love and joy for Singapore.</p>
<p>All in all, Regent Secondary School would like to wish Singapore a Happy
57th birthday and we are proud and exhilarated to celebrate this significant
day with the nation!</p>
