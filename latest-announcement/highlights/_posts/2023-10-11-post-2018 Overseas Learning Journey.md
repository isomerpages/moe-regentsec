<h3><strong>Xiamen, China</strong><br>5-9 November 2018</h3>
<p>The learning journey to Xiamen allowed our students to work together and
interact with youths from a different country. Not only did they get to
experience the lifestyle of the Chinese in Xiamen, they also appreciated
the history and culture of the places of interest visited.</p>
<p><strong>Day 1: Visit to Lianhua Middle School</strong>
</p>
<p><em>"At Lianhua Middle School, we learnt about the history of Xiamen, Min Nan proverbs and poetry. We had a great time interacting with the Chinese students as we performed songs &amp; dances for one another and we exchanged gifts too.” </em>–

<p><strong>Day 2: Visit to Gulangyu Islet, Shuzhuang Garden and Pottery DIY</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“I was impressed by how well Shuzhuang Garden is maintained and has both Eastern &amp; Western elements to make it a scenic hit amongst tourists. As for our hands-on experience at pottery-making, I found the activity to be very therapeutic and relaxing. It taught us to be patient and to improve our level of concentration.”</em> –

<p><strong>Day 3: Hakka Earth Building “The Legend of Minnan” Show</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“Studying the architecture and history of Hakka earth building was truly an eye-opening experience for us. It is fascinating how the structure managed to defend its people from intruders. Later it was also a treat for our eyes to watch the ‘Legend of Minnan’ show. We were amazed by the 360-degree revolving stage and the use of 3-dimensional effects, with real actors and virtual scenes. ”</em> –
