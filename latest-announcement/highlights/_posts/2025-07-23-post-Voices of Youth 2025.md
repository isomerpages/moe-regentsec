<p>This year, our students took part in Voices of Youth (VOY), an initiative
co-organised by Kranji Secondary School, Marsiling–Yew Tee GRC and the
People’s Association Youth Movement. The event brought together students
from various schools, providing a meaningful platform for them to exercise
student agency, raise awareness about community issues, and advocate for
a better future.</p>

<p>Through engaging discussions, students explored a range of issues that
are highly relevant to youths today, including AI and the Future of Work,
Climate Change and Environmental Responsibility, Misinformation and Fake
News, and Navigating Identity and Pressure in a Hyper-Competitive World.
Each topic encouraged participants to reflect deeply on current societal
challenges, explore emerging trends, and consider the roles they may play
as future leaders. Additionally, these conversations encouraged students
to reflect critically on the challenges faced by today’s society, while
recognising the importance of staying open-minded, building good habits,
and understanding how technology and human judgment can complement each
other.</p>

<p>Beyond deepening their understanding of these topics, students also picked
up practical skills. They learnt to communicate clearly, collaborate with
peers from different schools, and facilitate discussions using open-ended,
reflective, and summary questioning techniques. They also appreciated the
value of staying neutral during group conversations to create a respectful
space for everyone to share their views.</p>
<p>As the event wrapped up, the students left with a clearer understanding
of the issues around them and a stronger appreciation for the impact their
voices can make—no matter how big or small.</p>
