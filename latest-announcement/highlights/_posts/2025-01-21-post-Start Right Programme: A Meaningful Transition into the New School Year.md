<p>The Start Right programme, conducted during Weeks 0 and 1 of the school
term, was thoughtfully designed to help Regent Secondary students transition
seamlessly from the holiday break back into academic life. Its primary
objectives were to reorient students towards their academic goals, re-establish
school routines, and strengthen relationships among peers and teachers.
Through engaging activities such as the Secondary One Orientation programme,
class outings, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) learning journeys, industry
talks, polytechnic visits, and cohort workshops, students were warmly welcomed
into a supportive and structured school environment.</p>
<p><strong>Orientation Programme for Secondary One Students</strong>
</p>
<p>The orientation programme for new Secondary One students offered a vibrant
and supportive start to their secondary school journey. Activities such
as the Amazing Race, class bonding sessions, and mass games, led by enthusiastic
student leaders, helped students familiarise themselves with their peers,
teachers, and the school environment.</p>
<p>The highlight of the week was undoubtedly the campfire, where students
performed for their families, celebrating the strong bonds and camaraderie
forged throughout the orientation. This programme not only eased students’
transition but also fostered a sense of belonging and excitement for the
years ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Emphasis on School Routines and Values</strong>
</p>
<p>To set a positive tone, the Start Right programme also placed a strong
emphasis on reinstating school routines and values. Talks covering various
aspects of school life were included to reiterate school expectations,
cultivate a sense of purpose, and encourage students to reflect on their
roles and responsibilities for the year ahead.</p>
<p><strong>A Positive Start to the Year</strong>
</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Start Right programme ensured a smooth and meaningful
transition back to school. By reigniting students’ focus, fostering motivation,
and strengthening relationships, the programme set a positive tone for
academic success and personal growth.</p>
<p>Here’s wishing all Regenites and staff a fulfilling and enriching year
ahead!</p>
