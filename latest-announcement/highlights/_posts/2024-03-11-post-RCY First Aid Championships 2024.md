<p>Our Red Cross Youth cadets showcased their expertise and commitment to
first aid at the recent First Aid Championships, a prestigious national
competition organised by the Singapore Red Cross. This event serves as
a platform to emphasize the vital role of first aid skills in our cadets.</p>
<p>The competition, held on March 2, 2024, attracted hundreds of participants
from various schools, all eager to demonstrate their proficiency in handling
simulated emergencies within timed conditions. Prior to the Championships,
our cadets underwent intensive training workshops, where they refined their
critical thinking, problem-solving, and case management abilities.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges posed during the Championships, our cadets exhibited
remarkable resilience and teamwork throughout the competition. Their efforts
culminated in a significant achievement, as they emerged as one of the
top 12 finalistsâ€”a new record for our unit. Furthermore, they were honoured
with the Gold award for their adept handling of a diverse range of critical
scenarios.</p>
<p>We extend our heartfelt appreciation to our dedicated teachers and Volunteer
Instructors for their unwavering support throughout this journey. Their
guidance and encouragement played a pivotal role in our cadets' success.
With great enthusiasm, we eagerly anticipate participating in next year's
edition, furthering our commitment to promoting the importance of first
aid education in our cadets.</p>
