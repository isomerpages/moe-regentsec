<p>From 25 to 27 March 2024, our industrious students from 3 Pride embarked
on a captivating learning journey at ITE College West and delved into the
world of intelligent facility management through the Applied Learning Module
(ApLM) course!</p>
<p>The course, entitled "Intelligent Facility Management," offered a sneak
peek into Singapore's evolution into a smart nation. Our students had the
rare opportunity to get hands-on with cutting-edge technology, including
drones for visual building inspection. They also got their hands dirty
with electrical circuits, connecting live wires, earth wires, and neutral
wires like seasoned professionals.</p>
<p>But the excitement did not stop there. Our students were transported into
the realm of virtual reality (VR), where they delved deeper into the complexities
of intelligent facility management. Through immersive VR sessions, they
dissected intricate scenarios, honing their problem-solving skills and
expanding their cognitive horizons.</p>
<p>Congratulations to our students for seizing this invaluable opportunity
to expand their knowledge and practical skills!</p>
