<h4>Regentstorians Explore the Asian Civilisations Museum</h4>
<p>On July 16th, the Secondary 1 Regentstorians embarked on a meaningful
learning journey to the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), located in the
heart of Singapore’s civic district. This visit, part of the school’s efforts
to extend classroom learning beyond school walls, was more than just a
museum tour. It was an enriching experience that deepened students’ understanding
of Singapore’s diverse cultural roots and the broader Asian heritage that
shapes our society today.</p>
<p>The highlight was the chance to be guided by trained student docents from
Singapore Chinese Girls' School (SCGS). Confident and articulate, these
docents brought the exhibits to life through engaging presentations and
well-researched stories. Students learned about ancient trade routes, religious
artefacts, and the influences of various civilisations on the region’s
development.</p>
<p>Listening to their peers from another school inspired our students to
see the value of student-led learning. It showed them the impact of taking
ownership of knowledge and the confidence that comes with sharing it with
others.</p>
<p>For Secondary 1 student Praveen Nair Prathana, the visit was particularly
memorable. He reflected, “I really enjoyed the visit to the Asian Civilisations
Museum! Seeing the ancient artefacts up close and listening to the student
docents made history feel real and alive.”</p>
<p>The visit not only broadened their understanding of Asia’s civilisations
but also encouraged them to reflect on their own role in preserving Singapore’s
multicultural identity. Walking through the museum’s halls, they were reminded
that history connects us all and that sometimes, the best teachers are
fellow students.</p>
