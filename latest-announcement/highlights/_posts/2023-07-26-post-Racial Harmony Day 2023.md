Regent Secondary School celebrates Racial Harmony Day with a series of cross-cultural activities conducted over the duration of a week. 

Firstly, our National Education (NE) ambassadors shared their experience participating in Quest for Harmony heritage trail with the school.

Next, we also invited Interaction Arts and Drama Network to our school to stage the drama performance, _Hope: A Lost Phone_, to share the importance of respecting and embracing different ethnicities, and upholding racial harmony in our society.

Finally, booths were also set up in the canteen by our NE ambassadors and Parent Support Group (PSG). There, our NE ambassadors shared interesting facts about the various places of worship of different ethnic groups. Regenites also had fun sampling the ethnic snacks, with many enjoying themselves thoroughly as they tried out different traditional games at our PSG booths. 

Student Tay Jin Yi from 4-Empathy remarked, “Celebrating Racial Harmony Day is truly an imperative occasion where many Singaporeans of different race, language and religion come together to celebrate our differences. It was truly a wonderful experience to experience the sense of national identity in Singapore.”

As PM Lee said, "There is nothing natural about where we are - multiracial, multi-religious, tolerant and progressive. We made it happen, and we have got to protect it, nurture it, preserve it, and never break it." We hope that this week-long event will remind Regenites of the need to stand united as one country, and guide them to recognise that multiculturalism is the key to our strength and progress as a nation.
