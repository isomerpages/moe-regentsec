<p>At Regent Secondary School, our Secondary 1 students recently participated
in an enriching workshop centered on Indian cultural practices. This immersive
three-day program featured activities such as Rangoli design, pottery,
and thoranam weaving, offering students hands-on opportunities to appreciate
and learn about the rich history and traditions of the Indian community.
Initiatives like this play a vital role in fostering cultural understanding
and appreciation in Singaporeâ€™s diverse society.</p>
<p>The Rangoli session introduced students to the intricate art of creating
colorful patterns using materials such as colored powders, rice, and flower
petals. Traditionally made during Indian festivals like Deepavali, Rangoli
symbolizes welcome and good fortune. Through this activity, students developed
skills in design and color coordination while gaining a deeper understanding
of the symbolic significance behind this beautiful art form.</p>

<p>The pottery activity provided students with insight into an ancient Indian
craft that has been cherished through generations. Under guidance, students
shaped clay into pots similar to those traditionally used in Indian households
for cooking and storage. This hands-on experience taught them patience,
creativity, and an appreciation for the cultural importance of sustainable
practices.</p>

<p>In the thoranam weaving workshop, students created decorative garlands,
typically hung at the entrances of homes during special occasions to symbolize
prosperity and well-being. Traditionally made using mango leaves, thoranam
embodies joy, celebration, and respect for tradition. Using ribbons, students
crafted their own thoranam and discovered the significance of these decorations
in Indian culture.</p>
<p>This workshop offered our students valuable knowledge about Indian cultural
practices and an appreciation for the rich diversity within Singapore.
Experiences like these contribute to the holistic development of our students,
nurturing respect and empathy for different cultural backgrounds and strengthening
the bonds within our vibrant community.</p>
