<p>Our Secondary Two students had a wonderful time at the National Museum
of Singapore on 11 January. Founded in 1887, Singapore’s oldest museum
seeks to showcase stories of Singapore and the world, through its exciting
line-up of exhibitions and programmes. Its galleries include the Singapore
History Gallery on level 1, and four Life in Singapore Galleries on level
2.</p>
<p>Students who went for the trip had a riveting time immersing themselves
in in a period when Singapore was under the Japanese Occupation up till
the Road to Independence. For Saiful Alam Shah and Toh Wen Bin of Class
2-Pride, it was mesmerising for them to know more about how people lived
back then. They were also inspired to know more about our nation’s post-independence
years.</p>
<p>After a hiatus from Learning Journeys due to the pandemic, we are glad
that our students had a chance to expand their horizons beyond the four
classroom walls and step into our enchanting past. We also hope that this
intriguing experience will make all of us more proud to be a Singaporean
or part of the Singapore community!</p>
