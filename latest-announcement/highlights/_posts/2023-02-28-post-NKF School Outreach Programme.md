One of the NKF Kidney Health Education Buses (K-MOVEAT) found its way into Regent Secondary School. Over four days, starting on 20 Feb, students boarded the bus to find out more about healthier living and eating habits.

Regenites were able to download the NKF SG app and interact with augmented reality (AR) technology to learn more about the kidney, the importance of exercise, and healthy nutrition. Personnel from NKF were also present to guide the students through the different stations.

In addition, an assembly talk was held for lower secondary levels, where students were encouraged to care for their kidneys, and prizes were given out to promote participation.

Let us all commit to making good choices in our diets and lifestyles!
