<p>For this year’s Limbang Mid-Autumn Festival, our Student Councillors once
again poured their creativity and teamwork into designing a series of exciting
and meaningful game booths for the community. Among the favourites was
“Football Mayhem,” played on a mini soccer field handcrafted entirely out
of cardboard. Other booths such as “Lantern on a Lake” and “Maze Escape”
showcased the councillors’ imagination and problem-solving skills, turning
simple materials into interactive and memorable experiences for all.</p>

<p>What made the event truly special was the sight of participants of all
ages—from energetic children to supportive parents and even elderly residents—coming
together to enjoy the games. Watching families laugh, cheer, and bond at
the booths warmed our hearts and reminded us of the strong, vibrant community
spirit that makes Limbang so special.</p>
<p>The Student Councillors and CCA leaders are grateful for the opportunity
to contribute to such a meaningful celebration, and we look forward to
more opportunities to bring joy, connection, and creativity to our community!</p>
