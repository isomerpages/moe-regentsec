<p>Guided by our mission to equip all students and staff to become responsible
advocates of the environment, Regent’s environmental programmes seek to
promote good environmental habits and involve the wider community in environmental
efforts. This year, our school’s project focused on upcycling as a way
to “be the change” in working towards sustainable living through conserving
resources.</p>

<p>This year, our students from the Environmental Sciences Club led the school-wide
effort to turn used items into new products, including mask holders, tote
bags, and coin banks. Ongoing recycling and energy-saving efforts have
also helped us become a greener school. Through this, we have effected
a positive environmental impact in our school and community. Let’s continue
to do our part for the environment!</p>
