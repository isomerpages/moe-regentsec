<p>In partnership with Canon Imaging Academy and PUB, our Environmental Science
CCA attended a Photography Workshop on 27 April 2022.</p>
<p>This workshop was curated specially for our school and provided participants
with an introduction to the science and mechanics of how cameras are designed
and function. Students were shown how to adjust camera settings effectively
in order to optimise visual results and how to best achieve the correct
balance between lens, light, subject and composition.</p>
<p>Apart from offering the space and time to learn new skills in photography,
the workshop also allowed our Environmental Science students a valuable
opportunity to take a closer look at their physical surroundings.</p>
<p>Seeing our world through the lens of a camera, we often look more critically,
evaluating the relationship between the natural and man-made environment
in which we live, assessing the natural symmetry as well as discordant
notes in our surroundings. In planning their images, students began to
understand the influence of our surroundings on how we perceive the world.</p>
