<h4>Regent Celebrates SG60</h4>
<p>This year’s National Day theme, “Building Our Singapore Together”, gave
us an opportunity not only to reflect on 60 years of our nation’s shared
journey, but also to reaffirm our commitment as Singaporeans to contribute
to the next chapter of nation-building.</p>
<p>On 8 August, the Regent family gathered in the school hall for a majestic
Observance Ceremony, marked by the Uniformed Groups’ patriotic display
and the symbolic march-in of the national flag. The live performance of
the National Anthem by our Concert Band made the moment especially meaningful.
Through the Recollections segment, students looked back on our nation’s
past and were inspired by the National Day message from the Minister for
Education, Mr Desmond Lee.</p>

<p>The Observance Ceremony seamlessly transitioned into the Concert Segment,
taking Regenites on a heartwarming journey across four significant time
periods in Singapore’s history. Each class participated in engaging and
symbolic games that tested their knowledge of our country, sparking both
excitement and learning. Our Performing Arts groups, Infocomm CCA, and
the Regent Pop Band presented a vibrant showcase of music and dance, culminating
in a spirited singalong of our favourite National Day songs.</p>

<p>The celebrations ended on a reflective note, as students discussed how
Singapore’s shared values have helped us overcome challenges and explored
ways they could contribute to a shared future. Their dreams for Singapore
came to life in Regent’s SG Reimagined Showcase—a captivating display of
artefacts accessible via the RGTSG60 Padlet.</p>
