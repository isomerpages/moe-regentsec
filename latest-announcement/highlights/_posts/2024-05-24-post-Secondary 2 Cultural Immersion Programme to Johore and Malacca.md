<p>The month of May was awaited with much anticipation and excitement by
our Secondary Two students. For most of the cohort, it marked the first
ever cross-border trip they would have with their teachers and classmates.
The 2 Days and 1 Night cultural immersion trip to Johore and Malacca, provided
the students with plenty of opportunities to learn about the historical
background as well as cultural and agricultural practices of Johore and
Malacca. During the trip, the students were given the chance to have close
interactions with students from a partner school where they participated
in cultural activities. This allowed students from both sides to understand
and appreciate the cultural differences and diversity between Singapore
and the Malaysian school curriculum and programmes.</p>
<p>During the trip, our students also visited a Johore farm (UK Farm) to
understand modern agricultural practices and better appreciate how our
food products are produced in the farm. In Malacca, students visited key
cultural sites such as Aâ€™Famosa, Dutch Square as well as a Baba and Nonya
museum to understand the historical and cultural evolution of Malacca,
making their Secondary One History lessons come alive. It was definitely
an unforgettable experience for our Secondary Two students.</p>
