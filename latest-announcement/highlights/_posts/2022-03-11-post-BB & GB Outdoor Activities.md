<p>School’s out… Adventure’s in!</p>
<p>On 26 February 2022, our Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade companies participated
in their first adventure outing of the year — kayaking and standup paddleboarding
at the BB/GB campsite!</p>
<p>It was truly a day of fun in the sun for many of our boys and girls. For
Tan Hao Yu (1-Pride), he enjoyed the feeling of being in the water as he
had not been to the pool for a long time since the start of the pandemic.
Shaynel Peh (1-Gratitude) even made some new friends during the kayaking
activity! Though Kayden Lim (2-Gratitude) was initially apprehensive about
being able to paddleboard successfully, he managed to maneuver the paddleboard
confidently over the course of the activity, and had a whale of a time.</p>
<p>There’s never a dull moment at CCA for our BB and GB cadets, and they
can certainly look forward to many more exciting adventures in the weeks
to come!</p>
