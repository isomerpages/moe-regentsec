<h4>“When your legs get tired, run with your heart.”</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>This was the slogan for the highly anticipated Regent Virtual Run 2022.
Similar to last year’s edition, our staff and students worked hard to clock
their miles for the period of 14 March to 1 April, making good use of their
time to run or walk. Exciting awards for the Best Individual and Best Class
were up for grabs too!</p>
<p>Through the event, Regenites were able to spend more time with their families
and friends, exploring various places in Singapore on foot while clocking
their runs. Together, our Regenites did an amazing job during the virtual
run, and lived out the slogan by staying the course to clock a whopping
total of 10,000 km!</p>
<p>An awards ceremony was conducted on 14 April to recognise the spirited
efforts of all. These included the top 10 boys and girls for each level
and the top 3 staff (male/female). We are pleased to announce that 1-Integrity,
2-Empathy, 3-Integrity, and 4-Empathy clinched the Best Class awards for
their levels! Kudos too to our Taekwondo team, which has been awarded “Best
CCA”!</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our award winners, and we hope to see all Regenites
continue to stay active and healthy!</p>
