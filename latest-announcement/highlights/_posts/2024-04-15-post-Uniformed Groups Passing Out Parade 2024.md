<p>Thundery showers notwithstanding, our Uniformed Group (UG) leaders took
centre-stage at our annual Passing-Out Parade on 12 April 2024, an important
milestone for all graduating UG cadets. The Change of Command was executed
smoothly with our Principal, Mrs Sng, and the Regent community bearing
witness to this momentous occasion. For Parade Commander Warrant Officer
Gregg Loo, the parade was certainly a moment to cherish, having played
an instrumental role as Boys’ Brigade Company Sergeant Major and Head of
the Uniformed Groups over the past two years.</p>
<p>Turning to face the Singapore flag one last time as one contingent, the
sense of camaraderie shared by our senior UG cadets—having stood shoulder
to shoulder many a time over the last few years—was palpable. Truly, we
would like to thank our graduating batch of UG leaders and cadets for their
selfless contributions to the CCA and school community. Taking the helm
of our four UGs are: Sergeant Josiah Eang (BB), Corporal Shaynel Peh (GB),
Corporal Kee Yi Ling (NPCC), and Corporal Sing Jia Qian (RCY). Congratulations!</p>
