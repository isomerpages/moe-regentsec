<p>On 12 January, we gathered as a school to celebrate Boys’ Brigade (BB) Day, which commemorates the founding of the Boys’ Brigade in Singapore. A hush fell over the crowd as our boys from the 91st Singapore Company marched into the hall, looking smart in their uniforms. Standing proud and tall and in tight formation, they led the school in the singing of the National Anthem and the taking of the pledge. Regenites were treated to a video montage thereafter, which showcased the uniformed group as well as its many activities.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights Post/BBFoundersDay2024_1.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights Post/BBFoundersDay2024_2.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights Post/BBFoundersDay2024_3.jpeg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights Post/BBFoundersDay2024_4.jpeg"></div><p></p>
