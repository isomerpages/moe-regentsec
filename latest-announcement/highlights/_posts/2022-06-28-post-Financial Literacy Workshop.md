<p>On 1st&nbsp;and 2nd&nbsp;June, our secondary 1 and 2 classes&nbsp;took
part in a Financial Literacy Workshop organized by Smart Co. This programme
was facilitated by students from Temasek Polytechnic and sponsored by HSBC.</p>
<p>Students learnt about financial knowledge through a board game called
L Cube which&nbsp;taught them the importance of Life-Long Learning by providing
a simulation of real life situations. This enabled students to experience
making education, career and financial decisions in a fun and risk-free
setting. The experiential learning also took them through the impact of
the different economic cycles.</p>
<p>The highlight of the workshop was having HSBC personnel from the region
share their experience working in the finance sector. It was a valuable
experience for our students to interact with regional leaders and CEOs.
Our students thoroughly enjoyed the session!</p>
