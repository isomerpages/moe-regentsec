<p>23 September 2021 was a momentous occasion for our Secondary Three students,
who received their National Registration Identity Cards (NRIC)!</p>
<p>They learnt more about the significance of the NRIC as a symbol of citizenship
and were engaged in a fun activity to check the formula behind their T-series
NRIC numbers. We hope today's event has inspired our Secondary Three students
in their journey as youths of Singapore!</p>
