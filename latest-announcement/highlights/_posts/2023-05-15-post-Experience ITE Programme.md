Through the recently concluded Experience ITE programme, some of our Secondary Two students had the opportunity to visit ITE College West. The visit gave them an insight into the various courses available and their entry requirements.
 
Apart from going on a campus tour to view the laboratories and workshops that each faculty is home to, our students also attended breakout sessions with the School of Business and Services, School of Hospitality, School of Electronics and ICT, and the School of Engineering. Hands-on activities carried out during these sessions encouraged exploration and the co-creation of knowledge by our student participants. Course coordinators were also present on hand to address any queries our students had relating to the courses offered.
 
For Mohamed Rafi (2-Gratitude), the breakout sessions were ‘fun and educational’ as they provided him with an overview of College life and what to expect as a student at the College. Lai Jin Yi (2-Honour) enjoyed the sharing by the College lecturers, which help deepen her understanding about the various modules, pathways, and career options post-ITE. ‘I learnt a lot from the breakout sessions. It was enriching to learn about the internship opportunities that ITE offers with major companies. I have also learnt that having good time management skills, and being a good problem-solver are very important as I continue to pursue my post-secondary education.’
 
Indeed, the Experience ITE programme has enlightened students on the post-secondary educational pathways available, igniting their motivation to pursue their dream courses in ITE and beyond!
