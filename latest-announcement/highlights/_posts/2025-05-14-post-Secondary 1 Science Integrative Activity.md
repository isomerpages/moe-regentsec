<h4>From Muddy Water to Bright Ideas: Secondary 1 Science in Action</h4>
<p>The Secondary One Science Integrative Activity brought science to life
as students took on a real-world challenge—cleaning muddy water using self-built
water purification devices. In a country like Singapore, where freshwater
is scarce and clean water relies on desalination and imports, this hands-on
experience was both relevant and meaningful.</p>
<p>Working in groups, students researched how filtration works in everyday
contexts, learning about materials like sand, gravel, and activated carbon.
With these insights, they designed and built their own water purification
prototypes using provided materials. Their goal was to transform murky
water into clean water by applying scientific principles such as filtration
and adsorption.</p>
<p>Armed with their new Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), students collaborated
online to refine their ideas and compile their findings. This digital teamwork
not only deepened their understanding but also fostered 21st-century skills
like collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>The highlight came when students tested their creations by filtering muddy
water and measuring turbidity—the water’s clarity—using a turbidity disc.
Through this, they evaluated their prototypes and discussed improvements,
turning trial and error into valuable lessons.</p>
<p>Each group then presented their findings, walking their peers through
the design process, results, and reflections. “I think it was interesting
as we could build our own filtration devices and try to see if it works,”
said Liang Shan Ning, capturing the excitement of learning by doing.</p>
<p>Beyond just science, this project empowered students to think critically,
work creatively, and tackle real-world problems—key steps in shaping confident,
innovative learners ready for the future.</p>
