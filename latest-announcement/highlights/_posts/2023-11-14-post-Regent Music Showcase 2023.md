The "Regent Music Showcase" is a highly anticipated annual event, organised with the primary goal of providing a platform for students to showcase the musical skills they have honed during their music lessons throughout the year.
 
This event is a testament to the creativity and artistic prowess of Regenites, allowing them to demonstrate their dedication, passion, and talent for the art of sound. From the enchanting pop performances put up by the Secondary 1s to the original composition showcases helmed by the Secondary 2s, the showcase is a vibrant celebration of music education and the emergence of young artists.
 
#### **Sec 1 Pop Band Performance**

In the Secondary 1 music program, students are introduced to playing three musical instruments: Cajon, Guitar, and Piano. Upon mastering these instruments, they will form their groups and will be tasked to put up a pop band performance within their class, by the end of the academic year.
 
This year, a special arrangement has been put in place for the Regent Music Showcase to allow more students to showcase their musical talents. This expanded setup differs from the conventional four-member band format. In fact, this new setup potentially caters up to 12 student performers per class. Each class will feature two keyboardists, two guitarists, and the possibility of up to four Cajon players and up to four vocalists, fostering a broader and more inclusive platform for student performances.
 
#### **Sec 2 Song Writing Performance**

In the Secondary 2 music program, students partook in the art of songwriting, using the software platforms such as GarageBand and BandLab. Collaborating in groups, students engaged in the creative process of determining the genre, narrative, and emotional atmosphere of their songs. They also made collective decisions regarding chord progressions and instrument selections.
 
As the year drew to a close, students participated in a class presentation, where they shared their original compositions with their peers, reflecting the culmination of their songwriting journey.
 
A minimum of five groups, distinguished for their exceptional songwriting, were chosen from the student cohort to present their unique compositions at the Regent Music Showcase. Among these five groups, the two most outstanding ones were further selected to represent our school in the Youth Station project, a nationwide initiative organised by the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF).
