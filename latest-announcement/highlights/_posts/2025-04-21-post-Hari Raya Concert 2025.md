<h4>Hari Raya Concert 2025: A Celebration of Culture, Unity and Joy</h4>
<p>The harmonious melodies of Zapin, the magical chimes of Gamelan, the joyous
drumbeats, and the uplifting voices of singers intertwined gracefully to
illuminate vibrant performances in Malay dance, Pencak Silat, Wayang Kulit,
and a lively pop band sing-along session.</p>
<p>For the first time, the concert featured Wayang Kulit—a traditional shadow
puppet presentation that brought stories to life while educating the audience
about Hari Raya Aidilfitri. This unique addition sparked curiosity among
Regenites, who eagerly engaged in an interactive quiz about the festival’s
significance. This was further enriched by the elegance of the Tarian Zapin
Aidilfitri and the dynamic, warrior-like movements of the Pencak Silat
performers, drawing both awe and admiration from the audience.</p>

shared her heartfelt reflection: <em>“Performing at the Hari Raya concert was an honour. Leading a dance, strengthening friendships, and sharing traditions made it unforgettable. Despite challenges, we persevered and cherished every moment.”</em>
</p>
<p>Adding to the cultural tapestry of the evening was the powerful Pencak
Silat segment. Muhammad Qayyum Bin Faizal (1D), who took part in the performance,
reflected on his experience: <em>“Participating in the Hari Raya concert was thrilling. Mastering silat in a short time was tough, but I embraced it wholeheartedly. I hope for more opportunities ahead.”</em>

identity, heritage, and community. Embracing the spirit of “Regenites for
Regenites,” student-led performances blossomed with cultural pride, forging
