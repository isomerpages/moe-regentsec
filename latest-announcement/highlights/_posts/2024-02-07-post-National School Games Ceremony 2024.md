<p>On 2 February 2024, we had our National School Games (NSG) Ceremony for
student athletes who will participate in NSG tournaments this year.</p>
<p>Amidst deafening applause, representatives from our Sports and Games Co-Curricular
Activities (CCA)—namely Badminton, Basketball, Football, Netball, and Taekwondo,
walked down the centre aisle of the school hall with great pride and honour.</p>
<p>The highlight of the ceremony focused on the motto, “Character in Sporting
Excellence”, where our Sports and Games CCA Leader, Anjelita (S4-Empathy),
led all student athletes in reciting the Athletes’ oath as a reminder to
uphold the virtues of sportsmanship in the Games.</p>
<p>The ceremony culminated in the presentation of the school jerseys to the
captains of each team, by our Vice-Principal, Mr Balan. The jersey presentation
symbolises our school values of Passion, Respect, Integrity, Determination
and Empathy (P.R.I.D.E.), which our student athletes will embody as they
don the school colours for each game.</p>
<p>We would like to wish our Sports and Games CCAs the very best as they
compete in this year’s National School Games. May they “Blaze Forth To
Glory”!</p>
