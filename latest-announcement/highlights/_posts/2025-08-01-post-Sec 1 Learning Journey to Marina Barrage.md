<h4>A Flow of Learning: Secondary 1 Learning Journey to Marina Barrage</h4>
<p>On 10 April 2025, our Secondary 1 students set off on an exciting learning
journey to Marina Barrage, building on classroom lessons about water and
conservation. This multidisciplinary trip seamlessly wove together concepts
from English, Mathematics, Science, and Geography in a hands-on, real-world
setting.</p>
<p>Students witnessed a live demonstration of the Marina Barrage dam in action,
gaining insights into how it helps regulate water levels and prevents flooding.
This was an eye-opening example of Singapore’s innovative water management
strategies. A guided tour of the Sustainable Singapore Gallery followed,
where students explored interactive exhibits on green living, clean energy,
and water recycling, deepening their appreciation for our nation’s sustainability
efforts.</p>
<p>Hands-on learning continued as students engaged in a fun recycling game
and tried their hand at upcycling. They turned old t-shirts into reusable
tote bags, a creative activity that reinforced their understanding of environmental
responsibility.</p>
<p>For many, it was both an educational and meaningful experience. Chua Xuan
Wei Eason from 1 Pride shared, “I learnt how to upcycle old clothes into
a tote bag. I also thoroughly enjoyed the water show as they showed how
the Marina Barrage dam works!”</p>
<p>It was truly a memorable day of learning, exploration and reflection!</p>
