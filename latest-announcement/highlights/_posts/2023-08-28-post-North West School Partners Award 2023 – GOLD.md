<p>We are delighted to share that Regent Secondary School has been awarded
the North West Outstanding School Partner Award 2023 - GOLD for our active
participation in North West Community Development Council (NWCDC) programmes!</p>
<p>We are grateful for our fruitful partnership with NWCDC, whose collaborative
efforts have given our Regenites the opportunity to participate in a variety
of meaningful programmes and to contribute actively to the community. Our
students’ learning experiences have certainly been enriched through these
initiatives.</p>

to Regent!</p>
