<p>On July 23, our Secondary Two students embarked on a fascinating learning
journey at the National Museum of Singapore, where they delved into the
rich and diverse history of our nation. This cohort experience provided
a unique opportunity for students to engage with Singapore’s past, meeting
iconic historical figures like Elizabeth Choy and the Samsui women, while
exploring significant moments that have shaped our nation.</p>

<p>As they walked through the museum’s engaging exhibits, students connected
personally with Singapore's history, experiencing it through the stories
of its people, places, and key events. The vivid displays and compelling
narratives sparked their imaginations, bringing to life the challenges
and triumphs of different eras. From colonial times to the post-independence
struggles and successes, the students were captivated and inspired by the
resilience and determination that have defined our country’s journey.</p>

<p>This immersive experience not only enriched students’ understanding of
Singapore’s heritage but also reinforced the National Day theme of “Together,
as One United People.” By reflecting on our shared past, students are encouraged
to appreciate the strength and unity that will guide us in overcoming future
challenges as a nation.</p>
