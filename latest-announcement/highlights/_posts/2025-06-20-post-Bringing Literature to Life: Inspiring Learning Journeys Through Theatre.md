<p>The English and Literature Department at Regent Secondary School recently
organised two enriching learning journeys that brought literature beyond
the classroom and onto the stage, offering students immersive, real-world
experiences of the texts they study.</p>
<p><strong>A Magical Evening with <em>Wicked</em></strong>
</p>
<p>On 11 April 2025, our Secondary 4 Elective Literature students attended
the spellbinding performance of <em>Wicked</em> at the Sands Theatre. This
school enrichment programme aimed to deepen students’ literary appreciation
through live theatre. From the actors’ emotive portrayals to the intricate
set design and compelling storytelling, students were captivated by the
magical retelling of the Land of Oz. The experience offered fresh perspectives
on character development, themes, and dramatic techniques—making literature
not just studied, but truly felt.</p>
<p><strong>Bringing Texts Alive for Lower Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Secondary 2 Literature students enjoyed an equally impactful experience
on 20 May 2025. A cohort of 40 students attended a live staging of <em>Perfecting Pratas</em> and <em>Don’t Know Don’t Care</em>—two
plays featured in their literature syllabus. Seeing the characters and
conflicts brought to life on stage deepened their comprehension and engagement.
Students gained a more nuanced understanding of plot and themes, while
the actors’ interpretations added emotional and visual dimensions that
enriched classroom learning. For many, it made the literature more relatable
and memorable.</p>
<p><strong>Lasting Impressions and Lifelong Appreciation</strong>
</p>
<p>These learning journeys not only strengthened students’ analytical skills
but also sparked thoughtful conversations about human relationships, societal
issues, and personal identity as reflected in the plays. By watching literature
unfold live, students experienced firsthand the transformative power of
the performing arts.</p>
<p>Such initiatives affirm our commitment to nurturing thoughtful, empathetic,
and culturally engaged learners—one performance at a time.</p>
