<p>The Singapore Youth Festival – SYF Arts Presentation (Secondary School)
is a biannual event organised to celebrate the vitality of our youth and
their diverse arts talents.</p>
<p>The SYF Arts Presentation aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>develop cultural awareness and appreciation through aesthetics education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serve as a platform for the development of character through the arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage mass participation in arts (CCAs) in schools</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For all Performing Arts students in Regent Secondary School, SYF is one
of the main highlights of their time in CCA. The students from the English
Drama, Modern Dance, Concert Band and Show Choir dedicated many weeks and
months of hard work to showcase their passion for the Arts. Learning to
use body language to tell meaningful stories, sing in harmony, move in
synchronized actions and fine-tune articulations were definitely not easy
but our students were resilient and determined to achieve excellence. The
preparation for this highly anticipated event was truly tiring, but the
process was well worth it. The students grew to become stronger performers,
developed a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Arts and forged
stronger relationships with their peers, teachers, seniors and instructors.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at how Regent Secondary School’s Performing Arts students
prepared themselves to participate at this year’s SYF. Do continue to support
our Performing Arts members and we wish them all the best. Let’s Blaze
Forth to Glory!</p>
