<p>A learning journey to Gardens by the Bay was organized for the Pure Geography
students to study environmental sustainable technologies and innovative
solutions used in the running and maintenance of the attractions. The students
learnt about the purpose behind the creation of the 11 Super Trees in the
park and how they help in water conservation and managing carbon emission
in running the park facilities and attractions.</p>
<p>After the hour long guided experience in the Cloud Forest, students executed
their planned tourism fieldwork by conducting interviews with visitors
to the attractions around Gardens by the Bay.&nbsp;This is the primary
data collection process of the fieldwork skills which is an essential component
of their O levels. Students were also treated to a complementary visit
to Flower Dome. This visit coincided with the Sakura Tokidoki event in
the dome.</p>
<p>Ashlee Lim (Secondary Four) shared that she has learnt about interesting
facts about the plants such as the Bromeliads and the Pitcher plants. Prince
June (Secondary Four) reflected that not only is the Super Tree a tourist
attraction in Singapore, it also collects rainwater to cool down the 2
domes, which is environmentally sustainable!</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity for the students to experience tourism concepts
beyond the classroom setting.</p>
