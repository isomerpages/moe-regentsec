<p>A sense of anticipation and pride were palpable as Regenites gathered
in the Hall to bear witness to the passing of the mantle of leadership
at our Student Leaders’ Investiture on 30 April 2024.</p>
<p>‘Igniting our potential’ was the theme of this year’s Investiture, a reminder
of the transformative power Regenites hold as agents of change in the community.
Applause and cheers resounded through the hall as the 13<sup>th</sup> Student
Council and incoming CCA Leaders marched down the aisle and were handed
their blazers by their predecessors. In her speech, newly-appointed President
of the 13<sup>th</sup> Student Council, Putri Nur Adawiyah Mohammad Faizal
(S3-Honour), outlined her wish to build a more inclusive school community,
where ‘every idea and suggestion is valued, and the unique perspectives
and needs of Regenites are recognised’.</p>
<p>A highlight of this year’s event was the Class Committee Badge Presentation,
a special segment dedicated to honouring the invaluable contributions of
the class committee, particularly our Chairpersons who serve as an important
bridge between their Form Teachers and the class.</p>
<p>As the baton is passed to our incoming student leaders, we wish them a
most successful term ahead. It is our fervent hope that they will build
upon the fine traditions and legacy established by those who have gone
before them, and to lead with integrity, compassion, and vision.</p>
<p>Together, may we continue to blaze forth to glory and let us harness the
boundless potential that lies within each and every member of our school
community!</p>
