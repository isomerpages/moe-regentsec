<p>Today, Regent ushered in the Lunar New Year of the Rabbit with a hybrid
mode of celebrations!</p>
<p>The day started off with students learning more about the significance
of the Lunar New Year and its traditions through a virtual Bingo game in
class. The lively and festive atmosphere was further heightened with a
concert in the School Hall. There was a show-stopping lion dance performance
as well as items put up by our very own Regent Modern Dance Group and the
Regent Revolution Show Choir. Students also got to learn about the intriguing
art of face-changing, and there was much fun and laughter to be had with
the return of our annual crowd favourite—the God of Fortune!</p>
<p>The celebrations concluded with a finale comprising Chinese New Year-themed
videos, and we all sang a medley of CNY songs with much gusto. Here’s wishing
all our readers and Regenites a bountiful and joyous New Year and may we
all leap to new heights!</p>
