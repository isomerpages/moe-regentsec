<p><strong><u>Malay Cultural Exposure: Wayang Kulit and Indonesian Cultural Showcase</u></strong>
</p>
<p>On 15 August , our Secondary Two students immersed themselves in a rich
cultural experience by attending a <strong>Wayang Kulit</strong> performance
titled <strong>"Wow Wayang"</strong>. This traditional shadow puppet show,
deeply rooted in Indonesian culture, offered a glimpse into one of Southeast
Asia's oldest art forms. The students were captivated by the lively storytelling
and vibrant visuals of the show. Some students even had the chance to try
their hand at manipulating the shadow puppets, gaining hands-on experience
with this intricate art form.</p>
<p>In addition to the Wayang Kulit performance, students participated in
the Indonesian Cultural Showcase, where they explored the cultural significance
of traditional martial arts and dance. This enriching experience provided
students with a deeper appreciation for Indonesian customs, values, and
history. Overall, it was a memorable and insightful journey that helped
students connect more closely with the heritage of their Southeast Asian
neighbors.</p>
<p>Our school remains committed to providing holistic educational experiences
that foster cultural awareness and appreciation. These events are invaluable
in broadening students' horizons and enhancing their understanding of diverse
cultural traditions.</p>
