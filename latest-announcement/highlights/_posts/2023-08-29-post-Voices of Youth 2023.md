What are Singaporean youths concerned about nowadays?

On 28 August, together with students from Kranji Secondary and Unity Secondary, our Student Leaders attended the Voices Of Youth, a post-National Day Rally (NDR) Dialogue with the Marsiling Yew-Tee GRC Grassroot Advisors, including DPM Mr Lawrence Wong and Mayor Mr Alex Yam at Kranji Secondary School.

Together with the Kranji Secondary Student Leaders, our Sec 3 student leaders also co-facilitated the small group discussions during the dialogue. It was a day of deep learning and fruitful engagement as the student leaders develop a better understanding of the issues emerging from the NDR such as the Majulah Package and the new housing classifications (Standard, Plus and Prime) Our student leaders also had the opportunity to provide suggestions and seek clarifications from the Grassroot Advisors on issues they are concerned about and would like to advocate. It was definitely an insightful occasion and our student leaders certainly look forward to more opportunities to interact and collaborate with our counterparts from our neighbouring schools.
