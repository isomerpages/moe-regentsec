<p>In March, our Secondary Three Literature students made a trip to the theatre
as part of the Literature Enrichment Programme. They watched Pangdemoniumâ€™s
production of Falling, now back for its second run after the success of
its initial staging in 2016. Written by American playwright Deanna Jent,
Falling explores family life in a household with a severely autistic child
and sheds light on the everyday challenges caregivers of persons with special
needs face.</p>
<p></p>
<p>By turns gripping and darkly humorous, the heartrending play had our students
on the edge of their seats, riveted by the stories of its characters and
the many poignant moments. The play, coupled with a post-show dialogue
with members of the autistic community in Singapore, left a deep impression
on our students. Many came away from the experience a little more thoughtful
and aware about the kinds of ableism that exist in society and attuned
to the themes of difference and unconditional love as exemplified in our
Literature set text, The Chrysalids. It was certainly an afternoon our
students would never forget.</p>
