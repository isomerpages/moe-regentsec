<p>On the 21st May 2022, Choa Chu Kang residents attended the Limbang Raya
Show, organised by the Limbang Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC),
held in our school hall. The event, graced by the Grassroots Adviser, Mr
Lawrence Wong, saw guests streaming into the hall donning their best Hari
Raya outfits.</p>
<p>Members of the audience were serenaded by live singing performances by
members of the MAEC as well as local talents Sufie Rashid, Rozaimi and
our very own Secondary 5 student Sarah Syazlina, who belted out songs such
Suasana Hari Raya by Sharifah Aini and Hari Raya by Najwa Latif.</p>
<p>The event was especially memorable for our Secondary Three students, who
in their newly-formed group, Putera Armada, performed their very first
dikir barat performance item on stage! Decked in baju Melayu, kain samping
(cloth wrapped around the waist) and tanjak (traditional headgear), the
students, trained by Regent’s Operations Support Officer, Mr Abdul Rahman,
sang and clapped to the beat of the gong and percussion instruments. Despite
coming from different classes and having few training sessions, the performance
was made possible due our students’ passion for Malay arts and culture.</p>
<p>On top of that, prizes that were given out to winners of stage games,
lucky draws, house decoration contest and best dressed individuals enlivened
the atmosphere. The delectable buffet spread and goodie bags that awaited
after the performance made it an event not to be missed as we celebrated
the joyous occasion. Although the month-long Hari Raya celebration was
drawing to a close, the festive spirit among guests was very much still
ablaze!</p>
