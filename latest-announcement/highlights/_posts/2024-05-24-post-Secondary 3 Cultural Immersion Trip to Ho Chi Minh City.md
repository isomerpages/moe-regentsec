<p>A select group of Secondary 3 students had an exciting chance to visit
Ho Chi Minh City of Vietnam month. &nbsp;During the 4 days 3 nights trip,
there were many learning opportunities offered as they explored the old
city via a City Tour. Among some of the places that sparked interest were
the Reunification Palace, History Museum of Ho Chi Minh City, War Remnants
Museum and The Central Post Office where students basked in the rich cultural
heritage of the city and learnt more about their unique history.</p>

<p>However, the highlight of the day was the visit to the Agriculture Village
where students participated in a farm-to-table dining experience where
they prepared their own lunch, something new for all of them. The group
also made time to visit and interact with children from the Masion Chance
Orphanage and Nguyen Gia Thieu Secondary School. There, students not only
exchanged performances to learn more about oneanotherâ€™s culture, but also
spent time taking part in group activities together, including teaching
common conversational English Language phrases to the children.</p>
