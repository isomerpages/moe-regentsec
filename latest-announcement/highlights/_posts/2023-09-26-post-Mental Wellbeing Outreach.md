Our school places great importance in taking care of our students’ mental well-being. In view of the upcoming examinations in Term 4, we have put up a series of meaningful activities to educate students on some important tips for them to take better care of themselves and look out for each other during this period.

Our Mental Well-being booths were manned by our trusted School Counsellors as well as our caring Peer Support Leaders, who have been trained on how to support their friends in need.

**Tips on Self-Care and Distribution of Stress Cubes**

Students can learn more about the importance of self-care through attractive infographic placed near the canteens. They are reminded that taking good care of their mental well-being allows them to give the best versions of themselves for the world, especially in the examinations. The Sec One students were also grateful to receive stress cubes, which is a wonderful tool to channel their energy positively and contain reminders on self-care tips.

**Good Sleep Campaign**

Our booths also feature the importance of prioritising sufficient sleep. As an extension of Term 4 Check-in classroom activity, the visuals provided students with valuable tips that they could employ to get a well-rested snooze!

**It’s Okay to Reach Out: In Collaboration with HPB**

These booths are an extension of the project we undertook in Term 3, in collaboration with Health Promotion Board. As part of _It's Okay to Reach Out_ project, our PSLs engaged their classmates in some of the stories featured in the project and reminded their peers on the various channels where they could receive additional support.

**Open-When Cards**

Students were also delighted to write notes on the wonderfully designed HPB “Open When” cards. Our School Counsellor, Ms Kate, shared that students were appreciative of using these colorful cards to write meaningful notes to their friends and bring smiles to their faces. PSL Nur Shaqilla from S3-P said that she loved how beautiful these cards are, and she still held on to the notes written to her by a good friend.

**Beyond the Label (BTL)** 

Concurrently, the school invited BTL to set up an interactive and meaningful booth in our school. BTL seeks to rally greater community support and help-seeking behaviour by advocating for awareness surrounding the stigma experienced by persons with mental health conditions. Our students were delighted to show their support for people with mental health conditions by painting on some pebbles, which will be put up around the neighbourhood!

What a wonderful way to start Term 4 by reminding our students that we should take charge of our lives and our mental health!
