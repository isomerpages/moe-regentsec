We wrapped up Term 1 on a high note with Awards Day 2023, an annual event to celebrate the academic and co-curricular achievements of our students. Partners and friends of Regent Secondary School were also in attendance, where they received awards to recognise and thank them for their valuable contributions to the school.

Mr Subrata Chanda, Principal Technology Strategist at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Chairman of the School Advisory Committee, graced the occasion as its Guest-of-Honour. In his speech, he exhorted Regenites to stay nimble in a fast-changing world and to always be open to learning new things. In keeping with the theme of the event, ‘In Pursuit of Excellence’, Class of 2022 Valedictorian Chan Weng Hin shared about his journey of personal growth as a student and a leader in Regent, and inspired his juniors with his story of determination and tenacity.

It was indeed heartening to see past and present Regenites gathered at this event cheering one another on. May we continue to stay true to our flaming spirit, with blazing determination, to soar to ever greater heights!
