<p>Our Student Councillors went beyond the school gates to become young advocates
for sustainability as part of the Reduce@North West initiative. Taking
learning into the community, they played an active role in promoting environmentally
responsible habits and encouraging residents to take small but meaningful
steps towards a greener future.</p>
<p>Guided by the goals to engage, educate and encourage, the student councillors
reached out to residents using thoughtfully designed posters to raise awareness
about energy and water conservation and the reduction of food wastage.
They translated sustainability messages into practical, everyday actions,
making the information accessible and relevant to households.</p>

<p>Through brief yet purposeful interactions, the students encouraged residents
to take action by signing up for the initiative, explaining the benefits
of participation and the collective impact of individual choices. In doing
so, they not only advocated for sustainable living but also helped amplify
the message beyond the school by empowering residents to share these practices
with their families and neighbours.</p>
<p>The experience strengthened the student councillors’ confidence, communication
skills and sense of civic responsibility. More importantly, it reaffirmed
their belief that young people can be effective agents of change.</p>
<p>Through Reduce@North West, the student councillors showed that when awareness
leads to action, and action is amplified through advocacy, positive change
becomes a shared community effort—one that begins with students who care
and choose to lead.</p>
