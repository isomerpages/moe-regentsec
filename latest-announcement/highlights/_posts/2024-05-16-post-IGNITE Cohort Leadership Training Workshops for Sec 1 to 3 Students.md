<p>As Nelson Mandela once said, ‘The youths of today are the leaders of tomorrow.’
At Regent Secondary School, this vision takes shape through our Community
Youth Leadership (CYL) Learning for Life Programme (LLP), where students
are given opportunities to lead and become catalysts for change in their
communities. To cultivate leaders at every level, our students undergo
a series of cohort leadership workshops yearly, through which they learn
important leadership and communication skills. The programme ends with
a capstone class Values in Action (VIA) project, where students advocate
for and rally their peers behind the causes that they care about.</p>
<p>This year, our Secondary One students embarked on an exciting journey
of self-discovery, learning more about their strengths, interests, and
preferred learning styles. They also picked up organisational skills and
strategies for enhancing personal effectiveness, such as goal-setting.
Building upon the foundations laid previously, the workshop for our Secondary
Two students delved into the intricacies of team leadership. Drawing upon
the Leadership Challenge Model, this phase of “Enabling Others to Act”
emphasises collaboration and communication. Our Secondary Two students
thus learnt about the art of public speaking and effective communication,
which will prepare them for engaging with diverse audiences as they carry
out their VIA projects.</p>
<p>At Secondary Three level, the focus of these workshops then shifts towards
thought leadership. This phase equips students to lead with purpose and
foresight. Our Secondary Three students learnt how to apply decision-making
tools and make critical judgements in terms of project management. As participant
Olivia Yun Yong Sze (S3-Gratitude) shares, ‘Through the leadership workshop,
I’ve learnt that an effective leader is not one who works alone but rather
one who is able to rally the group to achieve their goals together as one.
I’ve learnt how to better manage my time—which is something I struggle
with—and these are transferable skills which I can definitely use in my
daily life too. Overall, the cohort leadership workshops were insightful
as the lessons were meaningful, and they have helped build my confidence
as a leader and thinker.’</p>
