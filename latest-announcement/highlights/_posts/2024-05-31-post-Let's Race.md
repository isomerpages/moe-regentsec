<p>In our efforts to galvanise Regenites towards becoming socially responsible
stewards of the environment, our school embarked on a 5-week journey to
empower students to “<strong>R</strong>educe our <strong>A</strong>ir pollution
and <strong>C</strong>arbon <strong>E</strong>missions” (RACE). This is especially
relevant as climate change continues to be a pervasive issue that requires
our attention.</p>

<p>Our journey towards achieving a more sustainable lifestyle started with
our dedicated Environment Champions passionately raising awareness among
their fellow peers on the detrimental effects that climate change has on
the planet and how human actions are escalating its effects. Our Champions
advocated for a greener lifestyle through everyday actions that Regenites
can take at home and in school to reduce their carbon footprint, which
included simple actions like walking.</p>
<p>At the same time, Regenites were introduced to “The Stridy Challenge”,
which involves the use of the “STRIDY” mobile application to record the
number of litter items collected and walking distance covered. Through
the usage of the STRIDY application, Regenites were not only able to catalogue
the different types of litter collected <em>(e.g. cigarette buds, cans, plastic bottles, tissue paper)</em>,
but also acquired insights into the collective positive impact that their
classmates, schoolmates, and even Singaporeans are leaving on the environment,
one piece of litter at a time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To create a healthy level of competition within the respective levels,
classes were encouraged to catalogue their litter items and walking distance
over a span of five weeks to clinch 2 coveted titles. “The Litter Heroes”
was awarded to the class that recorded the highest number of litter items
picked, and “The Regent Walkers” was awarded to the class that recorded
the longest walking distance covered. Congratulations to all the classes
on their wonderful efforts to make a difference to our environment.</p>
