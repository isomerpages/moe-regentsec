<p>Semester 1 saw our Secondary 1 and 2 students kickstarting their language-learning
journey with the Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) Programme. An MOE-initiative
launched in 2005, CCM provides learners with an elementary understanding
of a third language: Mandarin-speaking students will learn Malay, and vice
versa.</p>
<p>Slated to run till August, our students can, in this 10-week programme,
look forward to learning how to read and speak in the target language through
engaging activities such as role-plays and quizzes. To enhance their leaning
of the language, students will also be introduced to aspects of Chinese
and Malay culture—their customs, food, and festivals!</p>
<p>As they say, “Language is a gateway to culture”. It is our hope that through
these lessons, our students will not only take away with them conversational
skills in Chinese / Malay, but also a deeper appreciation for the diversity
of cultures and racial harmony that we have in Singapore.</p>
