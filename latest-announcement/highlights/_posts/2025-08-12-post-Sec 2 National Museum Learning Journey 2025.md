<h4>Stepping Back in Time: Secondary 2’s National Museum Adventure</h4>
<p>On 31 July 2025, our Secondary Two students embarked on an enriching museum-based
learning journey to Singapore’s oldest museum, the National Museum of Singapore.</p>
<p>In celebration of SG60, students took part in a special programme, ‘Artefactually
Speaking’, where they explored the SG60 exhibition showcasing key moments
in our nation’s history. Walking through Singapore’s milestones, from its
earliest years to the present, was both poignant and memorable as we celebrate
the nation’s 60th birthday.</p>

<p>Guided by friendly and passionate museum facilitators, Regenites experienced
history coming alive across different time periods – the colonial era,
the Japanese Occupation and the post-independence years. They were particularly
inspired by stories of remarkable individuals such as Elizabeth Choy and
Eunos Abdullah. Tales of daily life in the past, when rickshaws were a
common sight and opium dens operated in the city, fascinated them.</p>
<p>This learning journey not only deepened students’ knowledge of Singapore’s
history but also strengthened their personal connection to the nation.
Many left with a renewed appreciation for the resilience and vision of
our forebears – and a determination to cherish and contribute to the Singapore
story!</p>
