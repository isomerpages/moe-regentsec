A leader is nothing without followers.

An important group of leaders in the school is our Class Leaders who ensures the well-being of the students at the class level. Led by the Chairperson, the class committee consists of leaders holding various responsibilities such as our Peer Support Leaders, VIA Representatives, Environment Champions and many more.

Over the past 2 weeks, the leaders underwent various training sessions to prepare them for their roles and today, we celebrate their appointment on Tuesday, 31 January 2023 as they take the step to lead their class to greater heights and serve as the bridge between the students and the teachers in class.

Congratulations!
