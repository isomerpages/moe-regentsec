<p>On 21 May, Regent Secondary School celebrated its annual Environment Week,
“Let’s Be G.R.E.EN!”, with enthusiastic participation from the Secondary
1 cohort and various CCA groups. The event promoted environmental awareness
through creative student-led initiatives and collaborative activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of their Values-in-Action projects, Secondary 1 students explored
themes like water and energy conservation and sustainable diets. They showcased
their ideas through interactive displays and activities, encouraging their
peers to adopt eco-friendly habits.</p>
<p>CCA groups also brought their strengths to the cause. Highlights included
the Environmental Science students’ online <em>Whack-O-Trash</em> recycling
game, the Infocomm Club’s photo exhibition of local biodiversity, and the
Boys’ Brigade’s recycled bottle game station. The Design &amp; Innovation
Club impressed with upcycled crafts, while the Environment Champions hosted
a fun egg tray game.</p>
<p>The week concluded on a high note with an original jingle performance
by the Show Choir, leaving a lasting message on the importance of environmental
care.</p>
<p>“Let’s Be G.R.E.EN!” was a powerful reminder that small actions, when
multiplied, can lead to big changes.</p>
