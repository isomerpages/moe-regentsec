We are delighted to share that Regent Secondary School has been awarded the North West Outstanding School Partner Award (Gold) 2023 for our active participation in North West Community Development Council (NWCDC) programmes!

We are grateful for our fruitful partnership with NWCDC, whose collaborative efforts have given our Regenites the opportunity to participate in a variety of meaningful programmes and to contribute actively to the community. Our studentsâ€™ learning experiences have certainly been enriched through these initiatives.

Thank you, NWDC, for the recognition, and our heartiest congratulations to Regent!
