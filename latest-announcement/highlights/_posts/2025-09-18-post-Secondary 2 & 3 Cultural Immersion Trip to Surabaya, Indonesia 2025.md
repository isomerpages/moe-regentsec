<p>From 3 to 6 June 2025, our Secondary 2 and 3 students travelled to Surabaya,
Indonesia’s second-largest city, for a 4-day, 3-night cultural and immersion
programme.</p>
<p>Seventeen students, together with four teachers, enjoyed a rich cultural
experience. At landmarks such as the Majapahit Hotel and Heroes Monument,
they learnt about Indonesia’s fight for independence from the Dutch. Visits
to the Cheng Ho Mosque, the Blue Mosque, and Hong Tiek Hian Temple also
gave them a deeper understanding of Surabaya’s cultural and religious diversity,
as well as Indonesia’s multicultural heritage.</p>
<p>The warm welcome from our partner school, SMPK St Vincentius, made the
trip even more special. The school had planned a meaningful programme that
gave our students insights into Indonesian and East Javanese traditions.
They took part in activities such as the Remo Traditional Dance, learning
to play the Angklung, and making the traditional food, <em>tempe</em>.</p>
<p>Another highlight was a visit to a local orphanage. Here, our students
put into practice what they had learnt in the Community Youth Leadership
Programme. They organised fun activities such as board games and keychain-making
for the children. This allowed them to be role models and make a positive
impact.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, our students developed a deeper appreciation
of Indonesian culture. More importantly, they learnt the value of being
active contributors and changemakers—lessons that will stay with them beyond
the trip.</p>
