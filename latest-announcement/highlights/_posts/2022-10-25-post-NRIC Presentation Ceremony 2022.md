<p>20 October 2022 was a special day for our Secondary Three students, who
received their NRICs from our Principal and their Form Teachers.</p>
<p>To kickstart the presentation ceremony, a lesson on citizenship was conducted
and our students learnt more about the significance of the NRIC and the
rights and privileges they enjoy as a Singapore citizen. Of course, with
these privileges come great responsibilities that one should uphold as
a citizen of the country. Our students then participated in an in-class
discussion where they thought about ways they could actively contribute
to our nation’s progress. Students pledged to do their part through small
actions like picking up litter to keep our country clean, serving National
Service, and shared their aspirations for making Singapore a better place
for all to live in. The ceremony rounded off with a photo-taking session
where our students proudly displayed their NRICs, now imbued with new meaning.
"<em>The NRIC is important in helping to identify Singaporeans. It is a significant document that recognises one as a citizen or Permanent Resident of the country. I am glad that I can finally identify myself as a true Singaporean, not just with my passport, but also with this card. It gives me a sense of belonging to the country, and I am very thankful for that</em>,"
shared Siti Nurul Aireen Binte Rozali (3-Respect).</p>
<p>For Tay Jin Yi (3-Empathy), the momentous occasion has helped shape her
understanding about what it means to have a sense of identity and belonging
to this place we call Home. "<em>I am forever grateful to our founding fathers and pioneers for all that they have done for our nation. Knowing this has made me more motivated to contribute back to society as part of Singapore’s future generation of leaders.</em>"</p>
<p>Indeed, John F. Kennedy once said, ‘<em>Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country</em>.’
It is our hope that our Regenites grow to become responsible men and women
who take great pride in defending and shaping our nation through civic
action and public service.</p>
