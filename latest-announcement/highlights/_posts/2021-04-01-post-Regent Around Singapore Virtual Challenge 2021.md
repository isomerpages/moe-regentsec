<p>In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Regent PE department has organized a
virtual run instead of a live event for this year’s Cross Country. Thus,
Regent’s Journey Around Singapore Challenge was created!</p>
<p>The challenge for every class is to clock 193km as a class (FYI: The total
distance of Singapore’s coastline is 193km!). Students were able to compete
with one another through a live leaderboard as well! Students were encouraged
to stay active and fit during the pandemic and to run together with their
family members as a form of family bonding.</p>
<p>During the two weeks of the challenge, students are to clock their distance
using a distance tracking application on his smart phones. Students will
then upload their distance clocked during the run and a screenshot of the
route that they ran. The upload was seamless and the instructions were
easy to follow! Students can keep track of the total distance that they
have clocked via the live leaderboard available on the website.</p>
<p>At the end of the challenge, awards are given out to the top 10 male and
female students of each level. Awards for best class per level and top
3 staff members were given as well. Overall, our students and staff are
enjoyed their runs and explored new places at the same time. Let’s stay
healthy during this period of time and we hope this challenge has motivated
everyone to continue to stay active and fit!</p>
