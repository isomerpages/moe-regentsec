On 24th October, our Secondary One students participated in the National Cyber Wellness Advocacy Challenge (NCAC). Our student Cyber Wellness Ambassadors proudly stepped forward as transformational leaders and took the lead to advocate for Cyber Wellness education.
 
Firstly, the Cyber Wellness Ambassadors attended a training programme centered on the theme of fake news to equip them with relevant cyber wellness principles and values. In line with the theme for the 2023 challenge “Be safe. Be smart. Be kind.”, the programme serves to raise awareness regarding contemporary cyber issues, such as fake news.
 
Through group discussions, the Cyber Wellness Ambassadors were also exposed to broader and varied perspectives on issues such as fake photos, videos, and news.

Once our Cyber Wellness Ambassadors were ready, they took on the responsibility to lead and teach their peers. Using Padlet, students were engaged in collaborative learning as everyone got to share their takeaways.
 
We hope that our students will continue to extend their influence as youth advocates and spread positive online to make the online space a safe one for all!
