<h4>Igniting Our Potential: Student Leaders’ Investiture 2025</h4>
<p>On 20 May 2025, Regenites gathered in the hall for the annual Student
Leaders’ Investiture, a meaningful event marking the transition of leadership
within our school community.</p>
<p>This year’s theme, “Igniting Our Potential,” captured the spirit of the
ceremony, highlighting the role students play as changemakers. Applause
rang out as the 14th Student Council, new CCA Leaders, and Class Committee
members received their badges—symbols of trust and service. The presentation
of Class Committee badges by Form Teachers underscored the strong collaboration
between staff and students in shaping class culture.</p>

<p>A significant moment was the ceremonial handover of blazers from the 14th
to the 15th Executive Committee, symbolising continuity and a renewed sense
of purpose.</p>
<p>In their speeches, Lydia Binte Imbran (President of the 15th Student Council)
and Muhammad Khairy Danish Bin Rozaini (President of the CCA Leaders) pledged
to lead with empathy, inclusivity, and unity. Lydia encouraged peers to
contribute ideas, while Danish spoke about fostering a vibrant CCA culture
where everyone feels supported.</p>
<p>The Investiture concluded with the recitation of the Student Leaders’
Pledge—a heartfelt commitment to serve and lead with integrity.</p>
