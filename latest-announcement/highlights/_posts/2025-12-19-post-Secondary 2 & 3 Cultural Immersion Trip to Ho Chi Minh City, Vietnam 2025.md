<p>From 28 to 31 October 2025, our Secondary 2 and 3 students embarked on
a four-day, three-night cultural immersion programme to Ho Chi Minh City,
the largest city in southern Vietnam.</p>

<p>A group of 17 students, accompanied by four teachers, participated in
a meaningful and enriching learning journey. During the trip, students
visited key historical landmarks such as the War Remnants Museum and the
Independence Palace, where they gained insights into Vietnam’s journey
towards independence following the Vietnam War. Visits to the Saigon Central
Post Office, the Golden Dragon Water Puppet Theatre, and the Ho Chi Minh
City History Museum further deepened their understanding of the city’s
cultural diversity and Vietnam’s rich heritage. Students also took part
in a farm-to-table cooking experience, where they learnt about sustainable
farming practices and how agriculture remains a viable and meaningful career
pathway in Vietnam.</p>

<p>In addition, a visit to a local orphanage allowed students to put into
practice the values and leadership skills they had developed through the
Community Youth Leadership Programme. They organised engaging activities
such as keychain-making and sing-and-dance sessions, bringing joy to the
children while serving as positive role models in the community.</p>

<p>The students’ learning was further enriched through a visit to a local
SME, where they received a warm welcome from the staff. Through presentations,
interactive quizzes, and panel discussions, students gained valuable insights
into potential education and career pathways, aligning with their Education
and Career Guidance learning.</p>
<p>Through these experiences, our students developed a deeper appreciation
of Vietnamese culture. More importantly, they learnt the value of active
contribution, service, and leadership, becoming changemakers who make a
positive impact on others. These meaningful lessons will remain with them
long after the trip has concluded.</p>
