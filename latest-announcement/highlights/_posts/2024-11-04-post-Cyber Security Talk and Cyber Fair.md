<p>On 23 October, our school hosted an exciting Cyber Awareness Day, filled
with engaging activities aimed at empowering students to make safer and
kinder choices online. The day started with a Zoom Assembly presentation
on cyber security by Mr. Dayang from Touch Community Services. His insights
into the importance of online safety, practical ways to protect personal
information, and steps to safeguard one’s digital well-being set the stage
for the day's activities.</p>
<p>After Assembly, students headed to the Cyber Fair at the canteen. This
interactive fair was designed to educate and inform students about three
critical topics in today’s digital age: cyberbullying, positive online
behaviour, and practicing kindness online. Each station provided unique
learning experiences that were both fun and impactful, giving students
practical tools for navigating the online world responsibly.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the Cyber Fair was the Cyber Safe Pop-Up Vending
Machines, an initiative brought to us by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore.
These interactive vending machines were more than just a fun attraction
– they were an educational experience! Each machine offered students information
on cyber safety tips, along with opportunities to answer questions and
win prizes. Through this interactive experience, students learned valuable
strategies for protecting their digital identities while enjoying the thrill
of winning rewards.</p>
<p>Additionally, game booths manned by our very own Secondary One Cyber Wellness
Ambassadors provided a hands-on learning experience. These dedicated students
guided their peers through a variety of games designed to reinforce lessons
on cyber kindness and the importance of positive online behaviour. Each
game encouraged students to think about real-life scenarios, emphasizing
empathy and respect in their online interactions. The presence of these
young ambassadors not only allowed for peer-to-peer learning but also highlighted
the importance of student leadership in promoting a safe online environment.</p>
<p>Students were enthusiastic participants throughout the day, eagerly engaging
in the activities at the Fair and conversations about online safety. The
chance to win attractive prizes added to the excitement, but more importantly,
each student left with a better understanding of how to be responsible
digital citizens.</p>
<p>Overall, the Cyber Wellness post-exam activity was a tremendous success,
blending essential education with hands-on fun. It served as a meaningful
reminder to our students about the importance of safe, responsible online
practices. Through this event, our students have become more informed,
aware, and ready to navigate the digital world confidently and safely.</p>
