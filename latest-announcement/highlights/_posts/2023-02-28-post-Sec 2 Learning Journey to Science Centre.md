An afternoon of exploration and learning!

Across three Thursday afternoons, our Secondary 2 students visited the Singapore Science Centre for a Science and Geography Learning Journey. There, they explored two main exhibitions: Energy Story and Urban Mutations.

#### **Energy Story**

Through interactive exhibits, our students learnt about the various sources of energy, how they are harnessed, and the pros and cons of each source. Students also had the chance to witness first hand how renewable sources of energy can be used to power our lives. For instance, students worked in pairs to direct a lamp to power solar-powered gliders.

This was especially valuable for the Secondary 2s as they had just completed their chapter on Energy Transfer as part of the Lower Secondary Science curriculum. Guided by an activity booklet, the students visited the various exhibits to find out more about Energy. This guided interaction with the various exhibits provided an opportunity for them to reinforce their understanding and boost their appreciation of the ideas learnt.

#### **Urban Mutations**

Our students also visited the Urban Mutations exhibition. Here, they learnt about the various issues faced by modern cities all over the world. The Urban Futures exhibit also allowed students to explore and learn about the innovative solutions to tackle challenges faced in urban planning.

#### **Free exploration**

Students were also given time to explore the various other exhibitions at the Science Centre. Many flocked to _Phobia²: The Science Of Fear_, an exhibition that explored common fears and the psychology behind them. Some students also visited the _Guilt Trip_ exhibit within the _Climate Changed_ exhibit. This interactive exhibit allowed them to see first-hand how their daily actions contribute to climate change. The _Earth Alive_ exhibition also attracted many of our students, and allowed them to learn about the physical changes to planet Earth and the manifestation of these changes.

Lee Zi Yan, Jodie from Secondary 2 shared that she had a great experience at the Science Centre. She reflected that the representations through models have helped her to learn the different concepts better.

This learning journey was no doubt an enriching, fun, and exciting experience for our Secondary 2s, and we look forward to our next learning journey!
