<h4>Celebrating Diversity: Racial Harmony Day Concert 2025 – Our People, Our Tapestry</h4>
<p>On 22 July 2025, Regent Secondary School came alive with vibrant performances,
heartfelt stories, and the united spirit of our multicultural community
as we celebrated Racial Harmony Day. This year’s theme, “Our People, Our
Tapestry”, shone a spotlight on how Singapore’s diverse cultural threads
are beautifully woven together to form our shared national identity.</p>
<p>The celebration began with the Culture Uncovered segment, where students
and teachers shared personal insights on their cultural backgrounds. These
reflections highlighted how different beliefs can share common values such
as empathy, discipline, and strong family ties.</p>
<p>A particularly memorable moment was a live Pipa performance of <em>Lan Ting Xu</em> by
Jay Chou, performed by Hanning from 1 Gratitude. Her skill and artistry
offered a beautiful glimpse into musical heritage and left the audience
captivated.</p>
<p>In the spirit of creativity and inclusivity, Secondary 1 and 2 students
took part in the Harmony Video Challenge, producing 1-minute videos centred
on the themes of <em>Food</em> and <em>Festival</em>. The winning entries
stood out for their thoughtful reflections on how food and cultural celebrations
can foster deeper understanding and stronger friendships across communities.</p>
<p>The concert ended on a high note with an energetic musical mash-up by
the Regent Pop Band, blending Mandarin, Hindi, and Malay songs into a joyful
and powerful celebration of unity in diversity.</p>
<p>We are proud of all our students and staff who contributed to making this
event such a meaningful success. As we continue to weave our tapestry of
respect, resilience, and harmony, may every thread bring us closer together.
Happy Racial Harmony Day!</p>
