<p>Fieldwork is an essential component of Geography as it provides a real-world
opportunity for students to explore the subject in relation to the real
world and encourages our students to be active participants of their own
learning.</p>
<p>On 14th&nbsp;March 2022, 23 Secondary 3 Pure Geography students conducted
a Geographical Investigation along Pasir Ris Beach to test out the hypotheses
they had previously crafted in class. Students collected geographical data
on the physical and human processes taking place along Singapore’s ever-changing
coastline. They also had a chance to walk along the mangrove boardwalk
to sketch and study the various adaptations of mangrove trees.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts and reflections of some of our Secondary 3 Geographers
after the fieldwork:</p>
<p><em>“At Pasir Ris beach, we had the first-hand experience of carrying out various fieldwork techniques which we learnt in the classroom. We also took a close look at the adaptation features of mangroves such as aerial roots. Through this fieldwork, I have a better understanding of the coastal processes taking place along Singapore’s shoreline. Overall, I had a really enjoyable and meaningful time there with my friends and teachers.” – Hidayah (3-Determination)</em>
</p>
<p><em>“Through the process of collecting geographical data along Pasir Ris beach, it allowed me to discover and challenge theories which were previously taught and discussed in class. This fieldwork has also allowed me to extend my learning beyond the classroom. We were fortunate enough to see the rich biodiversity found at Pasir Ris, such as monitor lizards, mudskippers, tree climbing crabs and even a snake! I had a wonderful time doing this fieldwork and hope that we have the opportunity to carry out similar fieldtrips in the future!” – Shinnel (3-Integrity)</em>
