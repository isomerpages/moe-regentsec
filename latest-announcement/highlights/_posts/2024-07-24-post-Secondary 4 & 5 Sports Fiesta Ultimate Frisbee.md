<p>On 28 June 2024, under skies that alternated between downpours and glimpses
of the sun, our graduating cohort gathered for the annual Sports Fiesta,
an exhilarating Ultimate Frisbee showdown that pitted our Secondary Four
and Five classes against one another in a display of skill and sportsmanship.
Despite the weatherâ€™s unpredictability, the enthusiasm on the field was
palpable, with students eagerly putting the skills learnt in PE lessons
to the test.</p>
<p>Class 4-Integrity emerged as the undeniable champions of the day, their
teamwork and strategic plays securing them the coveted title of Overall
Class Champion. Ong Kai Ler from 4-Integrity and Jacqueline Lee from 4-Determiation
were also recognised for their outstanding sportsmanship during the tournament,&nbsp;
and were awarded the Best Sports Boy and Best Sports Girl trophies respectively
amidst cheers and applause from their peers.</p>
<p>The success of the tournament would not have been possible without the
meticulous planning and dedication of the PE department and our Secondary
Three CCA leaders. Their efforts ensured a seamlessly-organised event where
every pass, catch, and goal contributed to a memorable experience for all
participants.</p>
<p>As our Secondary Four and Five students now turn their focus to the upcoming
national examinations, their performance at the Sports Fiesta serves as
a testament to their resilience and commitment, both on and off the field.
They not only showcased their athletic abilities but also demonstrated
the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and fair play.</p>
