<p>During the June holidays, several Secondary 2 and 3 Regenites participated
in an enriching 3-day learning journey at the Nanyang Polytechnic. Students
signed up for the Applied Learning Module (ApLM) – Healthcare in Action
to gain deeper insights into the healthcare industry. Regenites were engaged
in a diverse range of activities. These included measuring blood pressure
and breathing rates, putting on Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), applying
various types of bandages, conducting cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),
and using an automated external defibrillator (AED).</p>
<p>In addition to acquiring essential insights and transferrable skillsets,
the ApLM provided the Regenites with the unique opportunity to interact
with the lecturers and polytechnic students. This allowed our students
to gain a deeper understanding of the healthcare industry and provided
a clearer perspective on what student life is like for a polytechnic student.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her experience, student Tu Ee Ninn Lyvia from 3-Gratitude
remarked, “<em>This programme changed my perspective on nurses. It allowed me to develop a profound appreciation for these heroic warriors because I am now aware of their range of job responsibilities.</em>”</p>
<p>Similarly, Olivia Yun Yong Sze from 2-Integrity agreed that this programme
was an eye-opening experience as she gained a plethora of knowledge about
the healthcare industry. It was particularly heart-warming for her to learn
about how healthcare professionals and training students go to great lengths
to keep us safe.</p>
<p>As Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, once said, “<em>Ignite the mind’s spark to rise the sun in you.</em>”
We hope that this ApLM will ignite similar sparks of potential within our
Regenites. We believe the impact of this learning experience extends far
beyond its completion, propelling our students on a lifelong journey of
learning and growth.</p>
