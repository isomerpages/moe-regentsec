On 22 September, Regent Secondary School organised a special Graduation Assembly conducted in the school premise for our graduating cohort. This cohort has definitely come a long way, and gone through various milestones together. From the start of Covid-19 Pandemic (wearing of masks, Full HBL, keeping a distance from one another, etc.) to adapting to the New Normal and venturing beyond class-based activities, every experience that the graduating cohort has encountered presents an opportunity for learning and growth, shaping them into who they will become.

The afternoon was filled with joy, laughter and a sense of nostalgia as we walked down memory lane to revisit some of the key highlights of their school life.

We hope our seniors had a wonderful time during the celebrations and best wishes to all of them in the upcoming National Examinations. 

Blaze Forth to Glory, Regenites!
