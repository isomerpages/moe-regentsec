<p>National Day celebrations are more than just a date on the calendar; they
are a powerful reminder of our nation's journey, identity, and aspirations.
Participating in these events provides a unique opportunity to express
patriotism, connect with fellow citizens, and reflect on our collective
achievements. This year, the Regent Drama Club proudly took part in the
Limbang National Day Carnival 2024 on August 3, showcasing their talents
and school spirit.</p>

<p>The carnival was a vibrant celebration that brought the community together,
filled with carnival rides, engaging booth games, and dynamic performances.
Our Drama Club stole the show with a captivating short play that beautifully
explored the essence of the Singapore Spirit. Their performance left the
audience both entertained and inspired, drawing enthusiastic applause and
cheers. Parents, teachers, and fellow students watched with pride as our
young performers brought the story to life, their energy and creativity
lighting up the stage. The strong chemistry among the students, combined
with their teamwork and camaraderie, added an extra layer of charm to the
performance.</p>
