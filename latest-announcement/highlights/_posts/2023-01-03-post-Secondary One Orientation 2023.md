Secondary One Orientation 2023

A warm welcome to our newest additions to the school! Day 1 of Secondary One Orientation 2023 started off with a bang on 3 January 2023. Our Orientation Class Leaders (OCLs) burst in at our Opening Ceremony, proudly bearing the mascots of each class. Stay tuned as our Secondary Ones get to know each other through class bonding games and team-building activities, led by our Student Leaders!
