We bade farewell to the holy month of Ramadan and ushered in the month of Syawal with our Hari Raya Aidilfitri Concert on 18 April 2023.

Themed “Cahaya Aidilfitri” (Light of Aidilfitri), the Concert saw our student talents putting up a series of performances to showcase the rich cultural and religious traditions of the Malay-Muslim community in Singapore. There were dance performances by our Malay Language students as well as a show-stopping Silat display; our English Drama club also performed a sketch to illustrate the significance that the holy month holds for Muslims across the world. In keeping with the festivities, Regenites were also treated to a musical performance by the Regent Pop Band, who performed a selection of Raya songs old and new.

Rizq Nufail Bin Remy from 2-Empathy shared that he was thankful for the opportunity to be one of the emcees of the Hari Raya Concert. He has gained confidence and venture beyond his comfort zone to host the event.

Indeed, it was heartening to see all students and staff coming together as one to celebrate Eid with joy and thanksgiving!
