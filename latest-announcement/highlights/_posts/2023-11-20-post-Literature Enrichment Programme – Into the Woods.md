Last Saturday, our Secondary Two students spent an enchanting afternoon at the Singtel Waterfront Theatre, where they enjoyed Pangdemonium’s production of the award-winning musical, Into the Woods.
 
Featuring showtunes by theatre great Stephen Sondheim, the musical intertwines the plots of several fairy tales, and our students were delighted to see well-loved characters from the likes of “Cinderella”, “Jack and the Beanstalk”, and “Little Red Riding Hood” take the stage! They were riveted by the cast’s impeccable acting and singing, as well as the play’s elaborate sets that helped add to its emotional impact. There were moments of levity too, with the musical putting a fresh spin on these beloved fairy tales and having characters break the fourth wall.
 
The trip to the theatre was undoubtedly a rich learning experience for our students, imbuing them with a greater appreciation of the drama texts that they have been studying in the Literature classroom. A feast for the eyes and ears, the musical was, in all, a wonderful way to round off the school year!
