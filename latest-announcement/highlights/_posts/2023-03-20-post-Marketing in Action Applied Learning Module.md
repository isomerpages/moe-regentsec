<p>During the March school holidays, our Secondary 3 Principles of Accounts
(POA) students participated in a 3-day course, Applied Learning Module
(ApLM) – “Marketing in Action", conducted by Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Prior
to attending this course, students were equipped with knowledge of the
back end of business through POA lessons held in school. Through numerous
case studies and real-life fieldwork provided in this course, students
learn about the front end of business management and the fundamentals of
marketing, such as the "4 P's of Marketing" (Product, Place, Promotion,
Price).</p>
<p>Students also got to visit the Decathlon office, where Marketing Director,
Mr Kieran O'Shea, shared insights on how Decathlon capitalises on the 4
P's as part of its marketing strategies.</p>
<p>Next, our students toured retail shops to identify how these marketing
strategies were applied in real life. It provided them with an excellent
opportunity to witness marketing in action.</p>
<p>To conclude the course, our students designed their very own marketing
plans with their peers. They were able to put together holistic plans by
incorporating the newly acquired concepts gained from this course and the
accounting concepts learnt from school.</p>
<p>This course has sparked the interest of several students in business and
marketing. Student Claire Chow Wai Kei (3-Empathy) said, “<em>I would like to open my own business [in the future]. This course is beneficial to me as I can better understand how business works.</em>”</p>
<p>Student Lum Wern Kye (3-Empathy) also shared that the course was an eye-opener
and provided him with a glimpse of what Polytechnic life would be like.
The course also helped him better understand the decision-making process
of businesses.</p>
<p>It was indeed encouraging to see students enjoying themselves as they
explored new concepts beyond the walls of the classroom. We look forward
to seeing them scale to greater heights in their relentless pursuit of
excellence.</p>
