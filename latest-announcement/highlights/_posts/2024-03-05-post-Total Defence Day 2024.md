<p>2024 marks 40 years of Total Defence (TD40) in Singapore and we commemorated
TD40 with an exciting line-up of programmes in Regent Secondary School.</p>
<p>In keeping with this year’s theme, ‘Together We Keep Singapore Strong’,
our Cyberwellness Representatives and Peer Support Leaders shared with
their classmates on the ways Total Defence can be put into action. This
rich sharing on the pillars of Digital Defence and Social Defence were
done through informative and engaging presentations.</p>
<p>Our annual Total Defence Day Parade also exemplified this spirit of togetherness,
with cadets from our four Uniformed Groups—the Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade,
National Police Cadet Corps, and Red Cross Youth—coming together in a show
of strength and unity, similar to the many social groups that make up Singapore.
Our cadets also put together awareness campaigns on the pillars of Civil
Defence, Military Defence, and Social Defence and exhorted their peers
to do their part for our nation.</p>
<p>In addition to the exploration of the Total Defence game booths that were
set up by our National Education Ambassadors and alumni, Regenites also
participated in the inaugural run of Exercise SG Ready. It is an island
wide Total Defence exercise aimed at enhancing Singaporeans’ readiness
in times of crisis and disruptions. A food supply disruption simulation
exercise was also carried out in the school on 16 February, with the usual
canteen fare replaced with shelf-stable, ready-to-eat meals that featured
novel ingredients like plant-based seafood and local produce such as abalone
mushroom and barramundi. With climate change and supply chain disruptions
which are a growing reality in our world today, our students through the
Exercise, learnt more about Singapore’s efforts to boost food security
and the importance of being able to adapt, adjust, and remain resilient
in the face of crises.</p>
