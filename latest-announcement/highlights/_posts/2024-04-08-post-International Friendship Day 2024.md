<p>Our Regenites were in high spirits as they were treated to several performances
that commemorated International Friendship Day.</p>
<p>They were first regaled by the jaunty tunes of two pieces of songs played
live by our very own Regent Pop Band. Our audience gamely clapped along
to "Lemak Manis", a traditional Malay timeless classic of Malaysian music
appreciated for its poetic lyrics, melodious composition, and emotive performance,
and to "Pasilyo", a song well-known as a “wedding anthem” because of the
promise of eternal love that it expresses.</p>
<p>The highlight of the day was the panel sharing held by our very own international
students. The six students warmly welcomed questions on their experiences
of living in Singapore and shared the struggles they encountered while
adapting to our Singaporean culture.</p>
<p>It was an eye-opening session indeed for our Regenites learning about
the important role Singapore plays in ASEAN and fostering stronger friendships
with their international classmates.</p>
