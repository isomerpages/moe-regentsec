<p>As part of their Historical Investigation (HI), Secondary 2G3 students
visited the Former Ford Factory—an iconic World War II site in Singapore.
This enriching experience supported their inquiry question: <em>“How did the Japanese Occupation affect the lives of the people?”</em>
</p>
<p>At the site, students explored preserved artefacts, visual displays, and
historical documents. A key highlight was standing in the very room where
the British surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, offering a
profound sense of historical significance.</p>

<p>Students also read personal accounts from survivors, which provided emotional
insight into the hardships endured during the Occupation—deepening their
understanding beyond textbooks. Their engagement during the visit was commendable,
with thoughtful questions and reflective discussions throughout.</p>

<p>Back in school, the experience enhanced their final HI projects, enabling
them to craft evidence-based responses using primary and secondary sources.
The visit not only strengthened their historical thinking but also fostered
empathy and appreciation for those who lived through that challenging period.</p>
