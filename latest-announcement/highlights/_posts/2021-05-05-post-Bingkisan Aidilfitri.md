<p>In the spirit of giving and sharing in the month of Syawal, Regent’s Malay
Language Unit has embarked on project ‘Bingkisan Aidilfitri’. ‘Bingkisan
Aidilfitri’ is a collaboration between the Muslim staff of Regent Secondary
School and our graduating students to express our sincere appreciation
to our school support staff for their relentless effort in ensuring a safe
and conducive environment for all staff and students.</p>
<p>This initiative, collectively funded by Muslim staff of Regent Secondary
School, aims to share the joy of Hari Raya with the school’s support staff.
Through this project too, the teachers hope to instil a sense of gratitude
as well as to cultivate the spirit of giving back to the society among
our students. Giving back comes in many forms; monetary donation, volunteering
and sharing of gifts with the less fortunate. The spirit of Ramadan does
not only encourage believers to fast, but also to celebrate and reflect
on our lives as well as to count our blessings and live with the spirit
of generosity.</p>
