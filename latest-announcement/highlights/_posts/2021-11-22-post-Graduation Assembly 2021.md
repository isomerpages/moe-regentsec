<h2><strong>Happy Graduation to the Class of 2021!</strong></h2>
<p>The Class of 2021 has conquered many challenges that came their way.</p>
<p>As Regenites, they have also made many meaningful memories in school and
beyond. They have also made a positive impact on their peers, teachers
and their juniors. Through the Final Assembly, we celebrate them and in
turn, it was an opportunity for them to show gratitude to those who have
helped them along the way.</p>
<p>We welcome them as new members of our alumni and to the Class of 2021,
we wish you all the best for the upcoming national examinations.</p>
<p>Blaze forth to glory!</p>
