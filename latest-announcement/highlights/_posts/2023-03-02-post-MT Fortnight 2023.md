<p>In Regent Secondary School, Mother Tongue Fortnight activities adopted
a thematic approach with the Secondary 1 students participating in cultural
arts and craft activities such as Opera Mask Painting and Wau Kite making.
The Secondary 2 students were immersing themselves in the beauty of Chinese
Calligraphy and Khat Drawing/Javi Calligraphy while the Secondary 3 students
were executing the Chinese Wushu and Silat martial arts moves in precision.
The Secondary 4 students had the opportunities to create and design authentic
characters for the Shadow Puppetry Performance. This cultural fiesta programmes
have definitely enhanced Regenities' language literacy skills and enabled
them to appreciate one another's culture and traditions.</p>
