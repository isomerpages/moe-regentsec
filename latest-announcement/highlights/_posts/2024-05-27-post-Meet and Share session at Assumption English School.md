<p>Ever wondered what it would be like to meet a television celebrity in
real life? On 20 May 2024, five lucky students from Regent Secondary had
the privilege to meet CNA presenter Mr Steven Chia in the flesh.</p>

<p>The hour-long Meet and Share session was held at Assumption English School
and attended by students from various secondary schools in the cluster.
An award-winning journalist with over two decades of experience in the
industry, Mr Chia is a stranger to no one. As the current host for the
popular show, ‘Talking Point’-a television programme that tackles the hottest
issues faced in our society in innovative ways, his is the face that some
students have come to associate with modern journalism. It was therefore
a great learning opportunity not only for our students Lydia, Yadi, Kiean,
Hilyah and Syasmin from 2 Empathy, but also our English Language teacher
Ms Hidayah, who were able to glean first-hand insights into the journalism
industry from a professional.</p>
<p>The wealth of experience and advice shared opened a door of information
for those interested to dabble in journalism. There was also a Question-and-Answer
segment where students had the opportunity to ask Mr Chia questions on
his journey as a journalist. As members of the audience, our five students
walked away with a richer understanding of what it means to be a journalist
and with fresher eyes as to what the industry holds beyond the glitz and
glamour.</p>
