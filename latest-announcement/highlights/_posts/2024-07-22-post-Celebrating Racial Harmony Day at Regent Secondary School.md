<p>Last week, our Regenites were filled with anticipation as we commemorated
Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on 16 July 2024. RHD holds significant importance
as it marks the anniversary of the 1964 race riots, reminding us of the
journey towards a harmonious Singaporean society, rich in cultural diversity
and social cohesion.</p>
<p>This year, the theme for Racial Harmony Day was "Singapore: Our Multicultural
Mosaic." It was chosen to prompt our students to contemplate how each community
intertwines to create Singapore's unique cultural tapestry, while also
honoring each community's distinct identity within our nation.</p>

<p>To celebrate this theme, we organised our inaugural Regent Fashion Show.
Each class enthusiastically designed and crafted modern ethnic wear using
recycled materials. These stunning costumes were proudly displayed on our
very own model catwalk during our school's mass assembly.</p>
<p>Adding to the vibrant celebration, our Modern Dance club performed an
energetic routine that incorporated dance moves from various Singaporean
cultures. Meanwhile, our Parents Support Group set up an interesting booth
at the canteen where students could experience traditional delights such
as ‘kacang puteh’ and participate in traditional games.</p>
<p>The day was a true celebration of learning and cultural appreciation for
our Regenites. It provided a platform for them to embrace the richness
of Singapore's multiculturalism and reflect on the importance of harmony
in our diverse society.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing to foster understanding and appreciation
for Singapore's cultural diversity in the years to come. Thank you to everyone
who made this Racial Harmony Day at Regent a memorable and enriching experience!</p>
