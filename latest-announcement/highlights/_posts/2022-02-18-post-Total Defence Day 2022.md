<p>Total Defence is the cornerstone of Singapore’s deterrent strategy, and
is crucial to the continued security, survival, and success of the country.</p>
<p>This year, we commemorated Total Defence Day with a slew of activities
throughout the week, beginning with a parade by our Uniformed Groups on
Tuesday, 15 Feb. It was heartening to see our Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade,
National Police Cadet Corps, and Red Cross Youth cadets come together as
one for this momentous occasion.</p>
<p>Our weekly CCE lessons also continued to reinforce the need for us to
play our part to protect ourselves against hybrid threats. In keeping with
this year’s theme, ‘Together We Keep Singapore Strong’, our students created
artefacts to pledge the small ways they could help put Total Defence into
action in their daily lives. They also joined our Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors
at an interactive booth in the canteen where they learnt more about digital
defence and even participated in a quiz to win wonderful prizes!</p>
<p>On 17 February, our series of commemorative events concluded with a special
programme helmed by the Uniformed Groups. Our enthusiastic UG cadets stepped
into every class to promote awareness of and participation in the 6 pillars
of Total Defence. Students learnt new skills such as Basic First Aid and
familiarised themselves with the Public Warning System as well as the game,
‘Guardians of the City’.</p>
<p>Overall, we had a memorable TDD which enhanced our four key citizenship
dispositions: a sense of belonging, a sense of reality, a sense of hope,
and the will to act.</p>
<p>Together, we keep Singapore strong!</p>
