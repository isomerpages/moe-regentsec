Recently, our Secondary Two students enjoyed a Chinese theatre performance, as part of the MOE Cultural Performance Exposure Scheme aimed at enhancing students’ learning and appreciation of Chinese culture in an enriching and enjoyable manner.

Titled《孙悟空龙宫借宝》(“Monkey King Borrows Treasure from Dragon Palace”), the performance brought the audience on a wild ride around the Heavens and Earth in the Monkey King’s quest for the perfect weapon to combat evil. Apart from learning more about the characters of the classical Chinese epic, _Journey to the West_, students were also introduced to elements of Peking opera, regarded as one of the cultural treasures of China.

Overall, it was a delightful afternoon that allowed Regenites to gain greater insight into Chinese culture beyond language-learning in the classroom!
