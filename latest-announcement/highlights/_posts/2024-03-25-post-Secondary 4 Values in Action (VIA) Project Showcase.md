<p>Each year, our secondary four students embark on a class-wide Values-in-Action
(VIA) advocacy project, where they prepare and deliver presentations to
their secondary three juniors.</p>
<p>Through these presentations, Regenites have the opportunity to share with
their juniors the meaningful VIA projects they carried out as a class previously,
as well as advocate for the beneficiaries they had worked with. Best practices
are also shared with the aim of inspiring their peers and juniors to embark
on their own awareness campaigns and advocacy work.</p>
<p>On presentation day this year, our secondary four students had fun sharing
their work and insights with the secondary three cohort through videos,
skits, and exciting quizzes. They also shared with their juniors useful
tips on project management and brainstormed ideas for better engaging potential
beneficiaries to meet their needs.</p>
<p>We hope that the pearls of wisdom shared by our graduating cohort will
inspire and equip our Regenites to be transformational leaders and changemakers
within our community!</p>
