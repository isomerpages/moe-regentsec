The ECG Fair: Worldskills ASEAN (WSA) held at Suntec City Convention Hall on 24 July 2023 was an immersive and eye-opening experience for students from 3-Pride and 3-Respect.
 
They learnt about the importance of skills mastery, and how these skills are linked to education and career pathways. There were many exciting talks and workshops for students to attend on different industries, such as Info-Comm Technology, Creative Arts and Fashion and Transportation and Logistics. Our students were given the opportunity to attend a workshop on Social and Personal Services conducted by Bettr Barista Pte Limited and an Engineering Talk conducted by Singapore Institute of Power and Gas.
 
Nur Hadirah from 3-Pride shared that she is inspired to pursue Electrical Engineering after attending WSA. Ryan Yeo from 3-Respect reflected that he has gained greater awareness of the F&B industry through the rich sensory experience during the WSA workshop.
 
In addition, it was a truly fascinating experience watching Singapore competitors at the WorldSkills ASEAN competition arena pit their skills against their ASEAN counterparts.
 
Our students definitely had an exhilarating time at the ECG Fair and are grateful for the varied learning opportunities.
