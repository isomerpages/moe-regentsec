<h4>Sec 4 &amp; 5 Sports Carnival (Ultimate Frisbee)</h4>
<p>The long anticipated Sec 4 &amp; 5 Sports Carnival finally took place
on 20 May! The last time our Secondary 4 &amp; 5 students participated
in a Sports Carnival was way back in 2019. Hence, it was clear why many
of them were eager to join in the competition. Turning up in their respective
class t-shirts, the students came very prepared and dressed well for the
occasion! Besides the Ultimate Frisbee competition, various carnival stalls
were also set up for all to have fun and joy!</p>
<p>A total of 4 different categories were played in the Frisbee competition
â€“ Boys Cup &amp; Plate, and Girls Cup &amp; Plate.</p>
<p>Overall, the competition was intense with fair play much observed. The
students applied what they have been learning during the PE lessons and
thoroughly enjoyed the competitiveness spirit. The overall class champion
went to 4-Empathy. Mervyn Tan from 5-Gratitude and Nur Danisha from 4-Pride
won the Sports Boy and Sports Girl awards respectively.</p>
<p>Trophies and medals were also given out to the following Cup and Plate
winners by our Principal, Mr Leong.</p>
