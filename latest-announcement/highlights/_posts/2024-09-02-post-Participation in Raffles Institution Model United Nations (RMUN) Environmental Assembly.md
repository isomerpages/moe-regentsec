<p>As part of our school's Applied Learning Programme on Environmental Sustainability,
the Humanities Department sent a team of student delegates to the Raffles
Institution’s Model United Nations (RMUN) Environmental Assembly in May.
The assembly focused on pressing global issues such as biofuel usage and
plastic pollution, offering our students—Goh Bing Yang, Lim Ying Xuan Andrea,
Magpayo Edrin Jae Quias, and Matthew Loke Jia Cheng from 4-Gratitude—an
invaluable opportunity to engage in inter-school discussions and advocate
for environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>The days leading up to RMUN were both challenging and exciting. Our dedicated
delegates worked tirelessly to craft position papers that accurately reflected
the views of their assigned countries, while also refining their opening
speeches to ensure confident and impactful delivery. During the assembly,
they actively participated in council sessions and engaged in dynamic debates,
demonstrating adaptability and quick thinking when faced with unexpected
scenarios. Their ability to respond to new developments and seamlessly
integrate them into ongoing discussions highlighted their resilience and
strategic thinking. By the end of RMUN, our delegates had successfully
crafted a draft resolution and garnered support from other schools, showcasing
their persuasive skills and collaborative spirit.</p>
<p>Beyond these immediate achievements, the RMUN experience was truly transformative
for our students. It allowed them to forge meaningful connections with
peers from other schools, step out of their comfort zones, and enhance
their public speaking skills. Reflecting on his experience, Bing Yang shared,
“RMUN has taught me how to thrive in high-pressure environments. I’ve learned
what it means to be an effective speaker. Participating in the various
debates and council sessions has deepened my understanding of global issues
and helped me forge new friendships.” Matthew echoed these sentiments,
adding, “RMUN has profoundly shaped my understanding of our world. The
experience has helped me become a more confident public speaker and to
engage deeply in global issues, stepping out of my comfort zone and embracing
public speaking.”</p>
<p>We congratulate our delegates for their exemplary representation and impactful
contributions. Their success at RMUN is a testament to their dedication
and passion for environmental advocacy. We look forward to supporting more
students in participating in such enriching experiences in the future!</p>
