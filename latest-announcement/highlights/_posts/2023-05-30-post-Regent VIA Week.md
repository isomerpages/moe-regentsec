<h4>Bringing about positivity and changeâ€¦ Regent VIA Week</h4>
<p>As Term 2 draws to a close, our students were given the opportunity to
contribute back to the community during Regent VIA week. Throughout the
week, our Sec 1 to 3 students planned and initiated a series of community
outreach activities to benefit the school, neighbourhood and community.
This was a culmination of many weeks of planning during CCE and the Cohort
Leadership Programme that aimed to nurture our students into transformational
leaders and agents of change.</p>
<p>The Sec 1 students carried out an Environment Champions Exhibition with
each class adopting an environmental cause, ranging from Car-Lite Lifestyle
to Upcycling, to bring about awareness of how we can be more environmentally
conscientious in our daily actions.</p>
<p>The Sec 2 students organised a community carnival for the seniors in the
Limbang Community for an afternoon of fun and learning. During the carnival,
seniors were able to learn about growing an edible garden, watch student-led
song and dance performances and interact with our students in various games
and even sing-along via a session of Karaoke!</p>
<p>Finally, the Sec 3 students carried out their class-initiated VIA projects
with beneficiaries, ranging from seniors to the migrant workers. Each class-based
VIA project was carefully chosen by the student themselves based on their
interests and passion and we were glad that the students and beneficiaries
really enjoyed themselves.</p>
