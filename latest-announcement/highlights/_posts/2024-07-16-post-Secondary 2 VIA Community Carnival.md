<p>The long-anticipated event was a day of excitement and joy for the Secondary
Two students of Regent Secondary School. Months of meticulous planning
and preparation culminated in a vibrant community carnival dedicated to
the seniors of the Limbang community, as well as the parents and grandparents
of the Secondary Two students. This Values-in-Action carnival was designed
to engage and delight our senior guests through a variety of games and
activities.</p>
<p>The carnival boasted a wide range of activities, each tailored to bring
joy and entertainment to the participants. There was something for everyone,
including creative crafts like Tote Bag Painting, Canvas Painting, and
Air Clay, along with Edible Gardening sessions. A photobooth station was
also set up to capture cherished memories, ensuring that every smile and
shared moment could be treasured long after the carnival ended. Classic
carnival games such as ring toss and Bingo attracted enthusiastic participants,
creating an atmosphere of fun and excitement.</p>
<p>Central to the event's success were the befrienders and students who provided
companionship and assistance to the seniors throughout the carnival. Their
warm smiles and helpful nature ensured that every senior felt welcomed
and included in the activities.</p>
<p>The highlight of the carnival was undoubtedly the series of lively and
vibrant performances that entertained the crowd. The Limbang CACC Guitar
Interest Group and the Limbang CACC Ukulele Interest Group performed six
musical pieces in total, showcasing the talents of the seniors and drawing
resounding applause from the audience. For some of these seniors, it was
their first time performing on stage, making the experience even more special.
Additionally, each Secondary Two class presented unique performances, demonstrating
the rich talents within our school. These performances brought joy, nostalgia,
and a sense of togetherness, making the event memorable for both seniors
and students.</p>
<p>As the carnival drew to a close, smiles were abundant, and memories were
cherished. The Secondary Two students' tireless efforts over the past months
paid off, evident in the smiling faces and enthusiastic participation of
the attendees. The event beautifully showcased the power of community engagement
and the joy that comes from fostering connections between generations.
It was truly a day to remember!</p>
