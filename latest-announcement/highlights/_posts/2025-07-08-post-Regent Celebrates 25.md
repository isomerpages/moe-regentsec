<p>25 in 2025 – Regent Secondary School proudly celebrated this significant
milestone as part of Regent Celebrates 25. Prior to the event, students
and staff also took time to reflect on their journey. Several mementos,
such as the Regent25 keychain, also allowed us to treasure this moment
together.</p>
<p>On the last day of Semester 1, the school gathered with our various stakeholders,
including our esteemed partners and family members, to celebrate this momentous
occasion. Member of School Advisory Committee, Dr Poon Joe Fai, graced
the ventt as the Guest of Honour.</p>
<p>We relished the moment to recognise our students’ accomplishments in their
academic and non-academic pursuits. The Valedictorian, Lee Xin Yan Richelle,
inspired her juniors with her stellar achievement at GCE O Level of 6 distinctions
and her uplifting speech. Her words echoed the many batches of graduands
of Regent Secondary school who had exemplified the school values in their
pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;We also walked down memory lane by watching the video, Voices of
Regent, a montage that captured the essence of what being part of Regent
meant to our staff and teachers. A video montage depicting Regent over
the years was another powerful moment to capture a sense of nostalgia and
pride. The video allowed us to reflect on our journey and blazed our determination
for the moments still to come.</p>
<p>The event was also a spectacular treat of music and celebration. Regent
performing art groups enlivened the school spirit with their awe-inspiring
performances. The various artistic display not only showcased our students’
diverse talents but also captured the excitement of growth and the journey
of self-discovery.</p>
<p>With pride in our journey</p>
<p>And hope shining bright,</p>
<p>Celebrating Regent25</p>
<p>—where our future takes flight.</p>
<p>Blaze forth to glory!</p>
