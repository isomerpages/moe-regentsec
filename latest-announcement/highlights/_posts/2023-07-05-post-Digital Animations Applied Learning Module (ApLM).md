<p>Recently, a group of selected students from Secondary 3 and Secondary
2 got the opportunity to explore more about the makings of 2D animation.
Through attending the Applied Learning Module (ApLM) Digital 2D Animation
course, organised by Singapore Polytechnic, our Regenities were able to
gain insights into 2D animation.</p>
<p>Over the span of three immersive days, these budding animators sharpened
their digital media software skills. In addition to acquiring essential
theoretical knowledge, such as the 12 Principles of animation, our students
also ventured into the practical aspects of creating digital puppets -
implementing various effects and breathing life into their animations.
On the last day of the programme, our students skillfully fused the various
lessons and techniques they had acquired to create a mesmerising 10-second
animation as their final projects.</p>
<p>Reflecting on his experience, student Andre Qushairy Bin Mohammed Shaiful
(3-Pride) said, “<em>Although the assignment was challenging, it provided us with useful knowledge about the world of animation. Not only that, I also like how this course provided us with a glimpse of the polytechnic life.</em>”</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing many more Regenites explore their untapped potential
and nurture their passion in the days to come!</p>
