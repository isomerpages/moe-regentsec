<p>On 6 April 2024, our Secondary Two Regenites had a captivating time at
the Sands Theatre watching the Royal Shakespeare Company’s ‘Matilda’—an
award-winning musical adapted from Ronald’s Dahl famous novel. Matilda
explores the story of an extraordinary little girl who, armed with a vivid
imagination and keen intellect, stepped up to change her own destiny and
better the lives of others around her.</p>
<p>From the moment the curtains rose, our students were swept away by the
play’s energetic choreography and catchy melodies. Coupled with the intricate
stage designs, the tapestry of colours and movement captured the hearts
of our students as they sang confidently to the lyrics of famous songs
like “When I Grow Up”.</p>
<p>Student Asleigh Chua (S2-Respect) remarked, “I really enjoyed the ending
of the musical when Miss Honey emerged victorious against Miss Trunchbull,
reclaiming what had rightfully belonged to her. This made me feel a sense
of justice and happiness for Miss Honey. I realised that no matter how
bleak circumstances may seem, as long as one remains optimistic and never
gives up, things will change for the better.”</p>
<p>Similar sentiments were shared by Chua Oo Heng Marcus (S2-Empathy). “Everything
was so exciting, and I was so engrossed in the play that I lost track of
time! I had fun noticing how the stage directions added to the play’s mood
and atmosphere—how Matilda’s classmates became increasingly sluggish and
tired the more domineering Miss Trunchbull became, and how the music and
sound effects made her person sound louder and more intimidating. But when
Matilda stood up for her classmates, the mood onstage quickly shifted from
apprehension to rambunctious joy. Overall, watching the musical made for
a thoroughly exhilarating experience.”</p>
<p>Journeying with Matilda has allowed our students to understand the importance
of staying optimistic, having resilience, and embracing one’s unique identity.
Our students also came away with a greater appreciation for drama in Literature
as they saw how beloved characters were transformed from page to stage!
We are certain that this magical experience will linger long in the memories
of Regenites long after the curtain calls.</p>
