<p>The school is a place where our students forge strong friendships, for
whom peers are paramount. Positive peer relationships facilitate the provision
of care and a sense of belonging amongst students. Such relationships can
also be powerful channels of positive influence—just take a look at our
Peer Support Leaders (PSL)!</p>
<p>Our PSLs are trained in the three domains of peer support and relationships,
to help foster bonds between students in class and provide practical help
and support. They have also learnt how to befriend others and create an
inclusive environment in Regent. Ahminrul Quraisha from 2-Empathy shared,
‘I hope that putting up a birthday wall in our class will help everyone
to include one another. Remembering one another’s birthday is just but
one step to avoid making anyone feel left out.’</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing our friendly PSLs helping to better Regent’s
vibrant and uplifting student community in their spheres of influence as
student advocates for general wellbeing!</p>
