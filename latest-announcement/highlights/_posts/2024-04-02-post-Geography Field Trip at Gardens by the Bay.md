<p>On 11 March, the Secondary 4 Express Geography students embarked on an
exciting journey beyond the confines of their classroom. In a bid to foster
a more immersive and relevant learning experience, the Humanities department
organised a field trip to Gardens by the Bay for a Geographical fieldwork.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this outing was to allow students to delve into
real-world environments and explore geographical phenomena firsthand. Split
into groups, students were tasked with interviewing visitors and tourists
to gather data that would help them validate various hypotheses. This hands-on
approach required the application of geographical fieldwork techniques
and skills, offering students a practical understanding of the subject.</p>
<p>Beyond academic pursuits, the field trip also provided an invaluable opportunity
for students to gain insight into the world of tourism. By engaging with
visitors and observing the dynamics of a popular tourist attraction, students
were able to develop a deeper appreciation for the intersection of geography
and tourism in everyday life.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a highly rewarding day for our graduating classes, offering
them a glimpse into the practical applications of their studies and fostering
a greater understanding of the world around them.</p>
