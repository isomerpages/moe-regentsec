<p>So much happens every day, but how often do we notice the positive things
in our lives? There’s always something to be grateful for!</p>
<p>On 24 May 2024, we held our inaugural Gratitude Fair as a way to wrap
up Semester 1. Helmed by our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
Champions and Secondary Two students, and supported by our Parents Support
Group (PSG), the Fair provided Regenites with a platform to express their
gratitude for the things around them.</p>
<p>At booths adorned with vibrant tinsel curtains and cheerful decorations,
Regenites learnt how to express their gratitude through a myriad of ways—from
writing thank-you notes to their loved ones to interactive activities promoting
mindfulness. They also exchanged stories of appreciation with one another
through games such as “Roll-the-Dice” and “Pick-up Sticks”. The Air Clay
booth was a kaleidoscope of colours, with our budding artists moulding
different coloured clay into one-of-a-kind masterpieces to be gifted to
their loved ones. ‘The activities at the Fair helped me to reflect on the
things I’m grateful for in my life. I particularly enjoyed the board games
at the Fair, as I was able to share and show my appreciation to my friends,’
says Muhammad Ihsan Bin Yusri (S4-Respect). For CCE Champion Xavier Chen
(S4-Determination), helming the booth was a deeply fulfilling experience.
‘It was great seeing people make gratitude cards for their friends and
loved ones. I also appreciated having the opportunity to interact with
students from the different levels at the Fair.’</p>

<p>And the fun didn’t stop there! After school, our PSG and their children
participated in a Seal Carving Workshop where they learnt how to carve
their own seals. It was certainly an afternoon well spent for many of our
participants who engaged in the delicate art of a time-honoured craft and
at the same time, also enjoyed a spot of bonding time with their family
members. The personalised seals that they brought home with them at the
end of the session will, no doubt, serve as a lasting reminder of the love
and gratitude that binds families together.</p>
<p>As Kristin Armstrong notes, ‘When we focus on our gratitude, the tide
of disappointment goes out and the tide of love rushes in.’ We hope that
the Gratitude Fair has imbued in Regenities a renewed appreciation for
life’s simple joys and the people who help make each day a little brighter.</p>
