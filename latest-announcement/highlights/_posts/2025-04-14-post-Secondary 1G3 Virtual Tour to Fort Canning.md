<h4>Exploring History, Virtually: Regentstorians Embark on Their First Learning Adventure</h4>
<p>History came alive for our students as they embarked on an exciting virtual
tour of Fort Canning Hill, led by Lion Heartlanders Tour Company! This
immersive experience marked the launch of our inaugural Regentstorians
Programme, a special initiative designed to nurture passionate young historians
and cultivate a deeper appreciation for the humanities.</p>

<p>The Regentstorians Programme aims to train and empower students to become
ambassadors of history within our school community. Through a series of
enriching activities, hands-on experiences, and training sessions, students
will deepen their knowledge and champion the love for humanities.</p>
<p>During the virtual tour, students explored the rich historical significance
of Fort Canning Hill, uncovering its role in Singapore’s early development.
With the guidance of a tour expert, they navigated through key historical
sites, participated in interactive activities, and gained insights into
Singapore’s colonial past—all from the comfort of their classrooms. The
experience brought history to life in a fresh and engaging way!</p>

<p>For Zafran Syabil bin Mohamad Shamsul (1 Integrity), the tour was an eye-opening
experience: <em>“I enjoyed the virtual tour as it was my first time experiencing one, and it allowed me to learn more about places of historical significance. The activities prepared by the tour guides were engaging and helped answer some of my questions about Fort Canning Hill. After the tour, we even got to take home some spices from the Spice Garden at Fort Canning, which made the experience even more special. Overall, it was a memorable experience, and I look forward to similar opportunities in the future.”</em>
</p>
<p>Similarly, Justin Kum Jia Jun (1 Honour) appreciated the convenience of
the virtual experience: <em>“I really enjoyed the tour as it taught me more about Singapore's history and gave me a better understanding of what life was like during those challenging times. Having the tour conducted over Zoom was also a great experience, as it allowed us to learn comfortably from school without having to worry about the heat.”</em>
</p>
<p>With their first learning journey complete, our Regentstorians are now
one step closer to becoming leaders in the humanities. We can't wait to
see them continue their journey as passionate storytellers of Singapore’s
rich history!</p>
