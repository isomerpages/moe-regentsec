<p>To find out more about the dynamic nature of coastal environments, 15
geography students and 4 teachers conducted a Geographical Investigation
using the Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) at Pasir Ris Park on 17 March 2021.</p>

<p>Students carried out a series of fieldwork investigations, such as sketching
the coastal environment, measuring the beach profile and determining the
direction of longshore drift in order to test various hypotheses on the
relationships between the human and the physical coastal environment. One
experiment conducted was investigating how long an orange took to travel
from one point to another when carried by the sea waves. Back in the classroom,
students analysed the data collected to rethink and challenge theories
that they had learnt.</p>

<p>It was definitely an eye-opening experience for our young Geographers
as they continued to experience what it means to be a Geographer.</p>
