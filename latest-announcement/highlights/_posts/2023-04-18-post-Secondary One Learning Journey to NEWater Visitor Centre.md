Recently, our Secondary One students embarked on a learning journey to the NEWater Visitor Centre to learn more about Singapore’s remarkable water story. The Centre’s interactive exhibits and tour of the NEWater factory allowed students to better understand Singapore's water sustainability plan; it also enabled them to connect the dots in their learning of Geography, Science, and Mathematics at school. Indeed, this interdisciplinary trip has impressed upon Regenites the importance of water conservation—where every drop counts!
