International Friendship Day recognises the role that friendship plays in promoting peace amongst various cultures. We kicked off this year’s celebrations with a special edition of Regent Rave, an online Assembly programme showcasing the experiences of four students who come from ASEAN countries like Myanmar, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand. It was fascinating to hear these students share personal anecdotes, which paint a vivid picture of life and tradition in their home countries. As different as these countries may seem, what was apparent from the presentation was a shared love for food—the common thread that arguably binds us all Asians together!
 
The theme of ‘unity in diversity’ came alive for Regenites too on the second day of the programme, where they were treated to a handbell performance in the school hall. Students had an enjoyable time listening to creative renditions of popular tunes which fused Asian and Western instruments for a truly delightful musical experience. They also got the chance to try their hand at creating music with the handbells!
 
A week-long exhibition at the Canteen further impressed upon Regenites the challenges and opportunities faced by Singapore in Asia. Being uniquely positioned in a time where change is afoot regionally and globally, Singapore faces several vulnerabilities, and it is important that we continue to maintain positive diplomatic relations with our neighbours and the world at large.
 
All in all, we hope that Regenites come away from the programme with a heightened understanding of global issues and a renewed sense of purpose in their role as future-ready global citizens!
