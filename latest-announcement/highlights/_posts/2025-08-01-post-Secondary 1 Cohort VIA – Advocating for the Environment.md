<p>On 21 May, our Secondary 1 students took part in their cohort Values-In-Action
(VIA) project, focusing on raising awareness about environmental issues.
This year’s VIA theme centred on sustainability, with each class selecting
a unique environmental topic to champion. Topics ranged from sustainable
diets and car-lite lifestyles to energy conservation, upcycling, recycling,
plastic use reduction, and dengue prevention.</p>

<p>Over several weeks, students collaborated in teams to research their chosen
themes and brainstorm creative ways to educate their audience – the Secondary
2 students. They designed informative posters and engaging videos to highlight
key messages, facts, and tips related to their environmental topics.</p>
<p>To make the learning experience fun and interactive, each class also created
games that reinforced their messages. These included everything from digital
Kahoot quizzes to memory card challenges and even a creative twist on bowling
that incorporated recycling education. These games allowed their peers
to learn while participating in friendly competitions. The event was a
culmination of teamwork, creativity, and purpose.</p>
<p>More importantly, it gave students the opportunity to advocate for causes
they believe in and to use their voices to inspire change. Through the
process, they learned how to communicate effectively, work collaboratively,
and take responsibility as young stewards of the environment.</p>

<p>This VIA project not only deepened students’ understanding of sustainability
but also empowered them to make a positive impact in their school community.
By educating their peers and promoting environmentally-friendly practices,
our Secondary 1 students took an important step in becoming active, responsible
citizens of tomorrow.</p>
