<p>During the March holidays, a group of enthusiastic Regenites embarked
on a deep dive into the world of eye care at Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Applied
Learning Module (ApLM) on Eyesight Matters. This interactive session provided
them with a firsthand look at vision science, the importance of eye health,
and the role of optometry in daily life.</p>
<p>From learning about common eye conditions to experimenting with optical
equipment, Regenites explored the science behind clear vision through engaging
hands-on activities. They examined various types of eyewear and discovered
how lifestyle habits impact eyesight. A standout moment of the workshop
was the personalised hands-on session, where students measured each other's
pupil distances, cut tinted lenses, and even assembled their own sunglasses—bringing
home a one-of-a-kind, practical souvenir.</p>

<p>For Ashlyn Chuan Jia Ning (4 Honour), the experience was particularly
eye-opening: “The ApLM for optometry was interesting indeed. What piqued
my interest was the lens-cutting session. That session made me realise
I am more interested in polytechnic courses compared to Junior Colleges
(JC) as the hands-on activity involved was something new to me."</p>
<p>Beyond optometry, the module showcased the interdisciplinary nature of
science. Nur Rasyiqah Binte Masri (4 Respect) reflected on this newfound
perspective: “What I liked about the ApLM is that it taught me more than
just optometry. I learned how both Biology and Physics are applied in some
fields, rather than being dedicated to just one. Not only that, but I also
appreciated how the teachers were willing to teach with patience, understanding
that we are not at that level of education yet."</p>
<p>This experience served as a powerful reminder that just as education broadens
the mind, good vision opens doors to endless possibilities. As Helen Keller
once said, <em>“The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.” With newfound knowledge and awareness, these future changemakers walked away with a clearer vision—not just for their eyes, but for their future!"</em>
