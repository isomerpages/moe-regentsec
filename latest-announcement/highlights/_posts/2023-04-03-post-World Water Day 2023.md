World Water Day is held annually on 22 March, a day designated by the United Nations (UN) to commemorate the importance of water as a resource. In Singapore, we mark World Water Day with a month-long celebration to rally the community to appreciate and conserve water resources for sustainability.

At Regent Secondary School, we marked World Water Day with a slew of activities. Staff came dressed in blue to show their solidarity for the national movement for water conservation. Talks were also conducted by Regenites to raise awareness about the depletion of water resources worldwide and the urgent need to conserve it for the sake of all mankind. The Environmental Science club anchored a segment at Morning Assembly to share tips on how to conserve water both at home and in school. Our Environment Champions chipped in too with an interactive Kahoot quiz to engage their classmates on the topic.

Here’s what one of our Secondary Two students had to say about the commemorative activities in school: ‘I found the World Water Day commemoration in school meaningful. We do face water shortages around the world today, and it is important to take action now to help conserve water. My peers and I have pledged to do our part through our water pledges on display at the Canteen!’ (Ng Peng Swee, 2-Pride)
