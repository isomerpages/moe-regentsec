<p>Our Secondary Two and Three G1 students recently had the opportunity to
participate in the Experience ITE Programme at ITE College West, where
they gained valuable insights into the diverse courses available and the
entry requirements for each. This enriching visit provided students with
a deeper understanding of the educational pathways at ITE and the unique
learning experiences it offers as a post-secondary institution.</p>
<p>During the visit, students embarked on a guided campus tour, exploring
state-of-the-art labs and workshops used by different faculty schools within
ITE College West. They also took part in interactive hands-on sessions
conducted by the School of Business and Services (SBSS), School of Hospitality
(SOH), School of Electronics and ICT (SEIT), and the School of Engineering
(SOE). These sessions encouraged active exploration, creativity, and experiential
learning, allowing students to engage with real-world applications of various
courses.</p>

<p>Course coordinators were present throughout the sessions to provide guidance
and address any queries students had regarding the modules and career prospects
within each discipline.</p>
<p>By participating in the Experience ITE Programme, our students have gained
a clearer perspective on the exciting post-secondary options available
to them. This eye-opening experience has not only expanded their knowledge
of ITEâ€™s diverse offerings but has also sparked their motivation to pursue
their passions and make informed decisions about their future educational
and career pathways.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing our students take confident steps toward their
aspirations!</p>
