<p>Co-Curricular Activities are an integral part of student life in Regent
Secondary School. Our newest additions to the Regent family—our Secondary
One students—had a taste of our vibrant CCA programme with CCA Experience
Day, which was held over four sessions in January.</p>
<p>Students had the opportunity to participate in activities from the four
CCA groups (Clubs and Societies, Performing Arts, Sports and Games, and
Uniformed Groups), and our energetic Secondary Two to Four Regenites pulled
out all stops to showcase their CCAs with game booths, quizzes, and other
experiential activities. Needless to say, our Secondary Ones had an enriching
time learning more about what each CCA has to offer and mingling with their
seniors!</p>
