<p>It was a momentous occasion at Regent Secondary School as the vibrant
spirit of Hari Raya Aidilfitri filled the air. With the departure of the
holy month of Ramadhan, we joyously welcomed Syawal, a time for celebration,
gratitude, and humility.</p>
<p>At Regent Secondary School, we embrace diversity and foster cultural understanding
among our students. The Hari Raya Programme 2024 underscored our commitment
to promoting these cultural cohesion and social harmony.</p>
<p>As part of this year's festivities, Regenites from all levels took part
in an exhilarating Inter-class Challenge titled “One Day During Hari Raya”
on the morning of April 16. The challenge tasked students with showcasing
the themes of ‘Happiness and Gratitude’ through their creations using plasticine.
In under thirty minutes, students had to craft figurines depicting traditional
costumes, delicacies, and moments of family bonding typically observed
during Hari Raya.</p>
<p>It was truly inspiring to witness the creativity and teamwork displayed
by our students as they raced against the clock to mold their plasticine
masterpieces. The resulting creations were a testament to the spirit of
unity and collaboration that thrives within our school community.</p>
<p>With each figurine and scene, our Regenites showcased not only their artistic
talents but also their appreciation for the rich cultural heritage of Hari
Raya Aidilfitri. Through this event, we reaffirm our commitment to fostering
a school environment where diversity is celebrated, and all students feel
a sense of belonging.</p>
