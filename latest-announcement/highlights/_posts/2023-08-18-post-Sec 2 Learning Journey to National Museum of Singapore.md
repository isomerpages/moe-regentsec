Our Secondary Two students spent a fun-filled and meaningful time at Singapore’s oldest museum, Singapore National Museum, on 16 August for their cohort learning journey. To deepen their appreciation for the nation, students made personal connections with the country through its people, places and experiences in the programme called ‘Artefactually-Speaking.’. Students were captivated by the exhibits and were deeply engaged in the stories of Singapore as we progressed through many phases, from the colonial period, Japanese Occupation to post-independence. The new exhibition, Semangat Yang Baru, really opened our students’ eyes to the challenges we have overcome as a young nation. The learning journey has really inspired our students to embrace this year’s national day theme, “onward as one” as we persevered to overcome new challenges as a nation.
