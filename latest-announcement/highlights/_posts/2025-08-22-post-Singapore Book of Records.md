<p>Regent Secondary School has proudly entered the Singapore Book of Records
for achieving the “Most Number of Students Contributing to a Storybook
at One Location.” This remarkable feat was made possible through the dedication
of our students and teachers in the English Language and Literature Department.</p>

<p>Over the course of one month, 20 classes from Secondary 1 to 3 came together
to craft a collective story. Each class contributed a unique chapter, culminating
in a 20-chapter narrative that showcased the imagination, creativity and
teamwork of Regenites.</p>
<p>At the heart of the book lies a mysterious mirror in the school library
that reveals hidden perspectives of three main characters. Guided by Jamie
and Priya- 2 of the main characters, the story explores how students learn
to see the impact of their actions, discover compassion and foster inclusivity.
Along the way, Jamie starts an Art club — a safe haven for creative expression
and healing — inspiring the school community to come together in empathy
and creativity.</p>

<p>This achievement goes beyond recognition in the Singapore Book of Records.
It embodies the spirit of learning at Regent Secondary, where students
are encouraged to collaborate, reflect and grow through meaningful experiences.
Teachers played a pivotal role in guiding the process, but it was the energy
and ideas of our Regenites that truly brought the story to life.</p>

<p>This milestone would not have been possible without the hard work of both
teachers and students. As Helen Keller once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this project.
Let us continue to Blaze Forth to Glory!</p>
