<p>At Regent Secondary School, our Peer Support Leaders play an important
role in helping to make the school a safe haven for all students. As positive
“influencers” within the student body, our PSLs also take great pride in
advocating for causes they believe in.</p>
<p>On 24 February 2022, our PSLs led their classmates in an advocacy project
against bullying. They carried out a slew of interesting activities aimed
at helping to raise awareness about and rally their peers to take a strong
stand against bullying. Some of our PSLs engaged their classmates using
Kahoot and facilitated lively discussions on the importance of being an
“upstander” against bullying, while others shared practical tips with their
classmates on how to address bullying within their spheres of influence.
Our students also came together to use their artistic talents for good,
creating anti-bullying posters and other artefacts that were displayed
beautifully in their classrooms.</p>
<p>Overall, the message is clear: Regenites will stand up and speak out against
bullying!</p>
