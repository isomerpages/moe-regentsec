Our Secondary Two students embarked on a trip to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Centre to learn more about Singapore’s development story from swamp to bustling metropolis during the first week of 2023. For many of our Regenites, it was their first time at the gallery and they had a wonderful time exploring various exhibits that detailed the planning decisions undergirding Singapore’s growth. They also took a peek at sustainable living initiatives that Singapore has planned for the future. The visit to the gallery was a visual and kinesthetic learning treat for all, and which will certainly enrich our students' understanding of topics relating to sustainability in their Geography syllabus this year!
