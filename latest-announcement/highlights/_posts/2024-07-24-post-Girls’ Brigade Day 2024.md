discipline, and the spirit of service that define this uniformed group.</p>

<p>Under the gleaming lights in the school hall, our GB girls stood tall
in their immaculate uniforms, forming a striking tableau during the school’s
assembly parade. For many, this day was not just about ceremony but a reaffirmation
of values and dedication.</p>
<p>The highlight of the morning was the heartfelt message delivered by GB
President Ms Sharon Liat, urging the girls to embrace joy, generosity,
and the youthful spirit that defines the Girls’ Brigade. Her words resonated
deeply, reminding everyone of the enduring principles that bind the Brigade
together.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her experience as this year's parade commander, Shaynel
Peh from 3-Empathy shared her journey from nervous anticipation to triumphant
pride. ‘This year’s GB Day was my first time leading the parade in front
of the whole school, so I was very nervous. But after several rehearsals,
I gained confidence in myself and knew I could perform well on the actual
day.’</p>

<p>Indeed, Shaynel's confidence was well-placed as the parade unfolded flawlessly,
each movement a testament to the many weeks of preparation and hardwork.
‘I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I executed my duties without
any errors. I am incredibly proud of my company for giving their best.’</p>
<p>The day concluded with cheers and applause, marking not just a milestone
for our 81<sup>st</sup> GB Company but a reaffirmation of the values of
leadership, service, and unity that define our school’s community spirit.</p>
