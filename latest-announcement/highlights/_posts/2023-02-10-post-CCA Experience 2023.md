Co-Curricular Activities are an integral part of student life in Regent Secondary School. Our newest additions to the Regent family—our Secondary One students—had a taste of our vibrant CCA programme with CCA Experience Day, which was held over four sessions in January.

Students had the opportunity to participate in activities from the four CCA groups (Clubs and Societies, Performing Arts, Sports and Games, and Uniformed Groups), and our energetic Secondary Two to Four Regenites pulled out all stops to showcase their CCAs with game booths, quizzes, and other experiential activities. Needless to say, our Secondary Ones had an enriching time learning more about what each CCA has to offer and mingling with their seniors!
