<p>At Regent Secondary, we pride ourselves on embracing diversity and acknowledging
the unique backgrounds of our students. In the month of March this year,
we hosted a special programme dedicated to our International Students and
Permanent Residents. During this hour-long event, students had the opportunity
to share their experiences of integration within our school community.</p>
<p>In a creative and engaging manner, each student expressed their journey
of integration through Art. Using recyclable tote bags as their canvas,
they depicted elements such as food, architecture, buildings, and festive
celebrations from their respective nations or cultures. Through intricate
pencil lines and vibrant brush strokes, students not only showcased their
heritage but also discovered commonalities and differences among their
experiences.</p>
<p>The session provided an authentic and immersive platform for students
to share their unique stories with one another. It fostered a sense of
understanding, appreciation, and unity within our school community as we
embraced students of various nationalities into our school community.</p>
