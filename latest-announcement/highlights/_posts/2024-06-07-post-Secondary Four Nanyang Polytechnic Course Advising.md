<p>The Course Advising session, which was held at Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP)
on 15 May 2024, was an enriching experience for our Secondary Four students.
It provided them with invaluable insights into academic and student life
at the polytechnic as well as an overview of the evolving industry landscape
in Singapore.</p>

<p>Participants had the opportunity to dialogue with polytechnic lecturers,
and this fostered a dynamic exchange of ideas and information. Through
these interactions, students learnt more about the various courses offered.
‘It was an eye-opening experience as I was able to learn more about the
courses offered at NYP’s School of Design and Media. The school’s exciting
hands-on curriculum includes modules which will equip students with game
design and animation skills, which is something I am interested in,’ says
Ernest Liw En Ze (S4-Gratitude). Nurbalqis Fikrisya Binte Mohar (S4-Empathy)
concurs, ‘The Course Advising session allowed me to better understand what
the world of accounting, banking, and finance entails. I was intrigued
to learn that NYP students would have the opportunity to undertake a 6-month
internship at one of the many banks in Singapore. I am eager to enjoy such
rich learning experiences. Learning more about the school and touring its
facilities have motivated me to work hard for my O Levels and achieve my
goals.’</p>
<p>The enthusiasm and engagement displayed by our students underscored the
significance of the session in empowering them to make informed decisions
regarding their educational journey beyond secondary school. Armed with
newfound knowledge and clarity, our Regenites are poised to navigate the
final lap of their secondary education with purpose and determination to
realise their dreams and aspirations.</p>
