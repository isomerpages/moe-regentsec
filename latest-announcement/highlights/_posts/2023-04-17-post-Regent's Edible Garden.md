<p>What’s growing in our backyard?</p>
<p>To do our part in supporting food sustainability, our Environmental Science
Club is excited to embark on growing edibles in our school.</p>
<p>In the first session, the students sweat it out to build the planter beds
from wooden planks. In the second session, the students learnt to transplant
seedlings of edibles such as Xiao Bao Cai. This process requires delicate
handling of the seedlings and their roots. Our students have also experienced
broadcasting of the seeds.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to care for the plants daily by watering them and seeing
them grow! We are excited to have not just our members but also teachers
and students from the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade to help us in watering the
plants especially on Saturdays! Indeed, it’s a community of effort as we
cultivate sustainability habits!</p>
