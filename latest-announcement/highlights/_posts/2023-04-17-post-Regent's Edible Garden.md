What’s growing in our backyard?

To do our part in supporting food sustainability, our Environmental Science Club is excited to embark on growing edibles in our school.

In the first session, the students sweat it out to build the planter beds from wooden planks. In the second session, the students learnt to transplant seedlings of edibles such as Xiao Bao Cai. This process requires delicate handling of the seedlings and their roots. Our students have also experienced broadcasting of the seeds.

Now, it’s time to care for the plants daily by watering them and seeing them grow! We are excited to have not just our members but also teachers and students from the Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade to help us in watering the plants especially on Saturdays! Indeed, it’s a community of effort as we cultivate sustainability habits!
