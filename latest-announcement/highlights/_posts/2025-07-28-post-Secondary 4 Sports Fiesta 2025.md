<h4>Graduating Cohort Wraps Up with a Spirited Sports Fiesta!</h4>
<p>On the 4<sup>th</sup> of July, our graduating cohort came together for
an exhilarating Sports Fiesta: Ultimate Frisbee Tournament—a well-deserved
breather before they dive into their final preparations for the national
examinations.</p>
<p>The inter-class tournament was more than just a fun-filled event. It was
a lively celebration of teamwork, skill, and determination as students
took to the field with great enthusiasm. Each class strategised, communicated,
and played their hearts out, applying the Ultimate Frisbee techniques they
had learnt during PE lessons. The matches were packed with fast-paced action,
from sharp passes and quick sprints to well-timed catches that drew cheers
from their classmates. Beyond the competition, the tournament fostered
camaraderie and unity, with students encouraging one another and celebrating
every moment together. It was a meaningful way for the cohort to bond one
last time before shifting their focus fully to their national exams.</p>
<p>A huge shoutout goes to the Regent PE Department and our Sec 3 CCA leaders,
whose efforts in planning and organising the event made it a seamless and
enjoyable experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we applaud our Sec 4 and 5 students for their resilience,
sportsmanship, and unwavering spirit, proving that they are champions both
on and off the field.</p>
<p>Good luck, graduating cohort—you’ve got this!</p>
