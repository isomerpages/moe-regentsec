As we walk around Singapore’s colourful streets, we feel blessed and grateful that different places of worship can exist harmoniously side by side on our tiny island. This reflects the beautiful multi-cultural mosaic of our society.

On 29 May, our Sec 1 - 3 NE Ambassadors had a wonderful opportunity to visit some of these religious sites and learn more about how places of worship play a role in strengthening our social fabric and supporting communities of different races and religions.
 
Wendy from 2I shared that this learning journey was very insightful. She was fascinated to learn that the Buddhists believe in good karma by helping people and being responsible for their own deeds. This is a good reminder for us to be accountable for our actions. She was also very intrigued to learn about the monks’ minimalist lifestyle and how the temple collaborates with other charities to give donations such as food rations. She is heartened that people in our communities endeavour to help societies through these places of worships.
 
Qaifa from 2H was very amazed that at Tua Pek Kong temple houses not only one religion but at least three religions, namely Taoism, Buddhism and Hinduism. Being in the temple, she was impressed by the statues and murals in the shrines and learnt so much about important symbols in the different religions, such as the lotus and the "yin and yang". The trip has been eye-opening to know more about the various customs and cultures.
 
Overall, the NE Ambassadors had a fun and enriching quest for harmony and they would be sharing more about what they have learnt with their peers and schoolmates during the upcoming Racial Harmony Day.
