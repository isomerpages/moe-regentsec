<p>In the month of April, we celebrated International Friendship Day (IFD)
at Regent Secondary School! The theme for this year’s IFD is "Singapore
in the World". From 5th to 9th April, students took part in various activities
such as learning about Singapore's relations with countries around us during
our morning assembly programme as well as understanding more about COVAX
and Singapore’s contributions to the world during CCE lessons.</p>
<p><em>Information sheets about COVAX created by Upper Sec students</em>

<p>Our Upper Secondary students have also prepared information sheets to
educate their juniors about COVAX. Through this CCE-IFD lesson, students
are more aware of the need for countries to offer practical help in ensuring
the world is a safer place for all humanity.</p>
<p>Our NE Ambassadors have also been hard at work. On International Friendship
Day, our ambassadors led their classmates in completing a Crossword Puzzle
as well as a Venn diagram to build on students’ understanding about the
different countries around us.</p>

<p>We also had some of our foreign students from Vietnam, Malaysia and India
take to the screen to share about what life was like back in their home
country in terms of food, pastimes, festivals and education system. Through
these activities, students got to learn about the countries around Singapore,
and realized that beneath the differences we are all very much alike. Finally,
we capped off the day by having all staff and students wear yellow to school
to commemorate the importance of Singapore developing friendships both
within ASEAN as well as with the other countries around the world.</p>
<p>Happy International Friendship Day 2021!</p>
