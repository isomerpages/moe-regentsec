<h2><strong>CCA Exchange Day 2024</strong></h2>
<p>On 11 September 2024, our 17 Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) came together
for an exciting inter-CCA exchange programme, before the stand down for
the End-of-Year examinations. This initiative is aimed at fostering collaboration
among students, allowing them to explore and gain insights into each other’s
CCAs while acquiring new skills and best practices to bring back to their
own CCAs. The enthusiasm was palpable as students participated in various
exchanges, eagerly immersing themselves in the experiences of their peers.
For instance, members of the Show Choir had the unique opportunity to join
the Red Cross Youth for a day. While the Show Choir members learned essential
bandaging and CPR skills from their Red Cross counterparts, our Red Cross
Youth cadets delighted in discovering the art of singing and dancing in
harmony with the Show Choir. The high level of engagement from all the
participants underscored the success of this programme, as students not
only enjoyed their time but also expressed enthusiasm for next year’s exchange.
This initiative not only nurtures camaraderie among different CCAs but
also enriches the students’ skills and experiences, laying the foundation
for a vibrant and interconnected school culture.</p>
