<p>Our teachers and students donned colourful ethnic costumes to commemorate
this special day which marked the importance of maintaining racial and
religious harmony in Singapore’s multi-ethnic and multicultural society.
With this year’s Racial Harmony Day theme being ‘Common Spaces, Connected
Communities’, our group of teachers from the National Education Committee
planned meaningful activities to encourage our students to understand the
importance of common spaces in Singapore and how such spaces foster cohesion
and harmony. A key highlight was the rich discussion in each class about
their positive experiences with different ethnic groups. Students had fun
sharing their memorable moments with their classmates, while maintaining
safe distancing.</p>
