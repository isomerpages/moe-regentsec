<h4>Applied Learning Module (ApLM): Social Innovations for Future Change</h4>
<p>How can we tackle real-world social issues and make a difference in our
communities? That was the challenge posed to our Secondary 4 Social Studies
students during the Applied Learning Module (ApLM) programme at Ngee Ann
Polytechnic, held from 19 to 21 March 2025. Over three immersive days,
students explored pressing societal challenges, learned about social innovation
strategies, and applied their knowledge to create practical solutions for
a better future.</p>
<p>The programme encouraged students to step beyond their textbooks and think
critically about global and local issues. Working in teams, they identified
social problems, proposed solutions, and eventually presented their findings
to a panel of lecturers. But learning didn’t stop in the classroom—the
experience was enriched with two eye-opening learning journeys.</p>
<p>The first stop was the Science Centre, where students explored exhibits
highlighting key social issues, sharpening their analytical skills as they
connected real-world problems with theoretical concepts. Next, they visited
the Enabling Village, an inclusive community space that champions empowerment
for individuals with diverse abilities. The visit served as a powerful
reminder that everyone has a role to play in building an inclusive society.</p>

<p>For many participants, ApLM was more than just an academic exercise—it
was a personal journey of discovery and inspiration.</p>
<p>David Gabriel (4-Empathy) reflected, "<em>The 3-day programme gave me the opportunity to learn about global issues and made me realise how fortunate we are in Singapore. The group discussions were fun and educational, as we explored creative solutions to pressing social challenges. This experience also helped me think more deeply about my post-secondary options.</em>"</p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments, Walton Tan (4-Determination) shared, "<em>The ApLM programme was really engaging as we got to hear trainers discuss real-world issues. It also tied in with what we learn in Social Studies about globalisation, but with deeper insights beyond the textbook. The learning journeys made me more aware of the different social strata in our society, and I now feel inspired to do my part in helping the less fortunate.</em>"</p>
<p>Beyond deepening their understanding of social issues, students also gained
newfound motivation for their post-secondary aspirations. By engaging with
real-world challenges and collaborating on meaningful solutions, ApLM empowered
them to become future changemakers—driven, compassionate, and ready to
make a difference.</p>
