<p>On 21 February 2022, our newly-appointed Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors participated
in a fruitful induction programme organised by the Cyber-Wellness Committee.</p>
<p>They learnt more about the importance of advocating for civic-mindedness
online as well as how to look out for their peers as their Cyber-Wellness
Ambassadors. With the prevalence of contemporary issues such as cyberbullying,
“flaming”, and “cat-fishing”, our Ambassadors also equipped themselves
with the necessary skills to stand up for what’s right and report incidents
of online aggression promptly.</p>
<p>The session ended with our Cyber-Wellness community pledging to help make
Regent a safe place for everyone, online and offline. Here is what some
of our Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors have shared:</p>
<p>‘I pledge to do my part in not letting anyone be a victim of cyberbullying.’
(Riyan Fahrin, 1-Honour)</p>
<p>‘I pledge to help make the cyber world a positive environment for my peers
and I will help to educate others who might need help understanding the
importance of staying safe on the Internet.’ (Nur Hadirah, 2-Pride)</p>
