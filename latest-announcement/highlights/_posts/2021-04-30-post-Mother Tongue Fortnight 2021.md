<p>Regent Secondary School Mother Tongue Fortnight, which took place from
26th April to 29th April 2021, aimed to create an immersive environment
to promote the use of Mother Tongue languages beyond classrooms and encourage
cultural discovery through an authentic and fun learning experience. In
addition to learning and using the language, students were exposed to a
wide range of activities.</p>
<p>A wide range of activities, both within and beyond the classrooms, were
conducted to enable students to learn and use Malay Language in novel and
exciting ways.</p>
<p>Secondary 1 students had the opportunity to learn one form of handicraft,
namely Wau Batik Painting and a Virtual Tour Programme of Kampung Glam.</p>

<p>On top of those activities, the students were also able to experience
activity booths during their recess and lunch breaks. The booths showcased
different activities for the whole week. The activities ranged from Wau
Batik Painting, Traditional Games, Wayang Kulit puppet-making and Roti
Jala Making and displaying of Malay Hari Raya Cookies.</p>
<p>Students’ involvement had been very encouraging. They are clear indications
of our students’ love to use and learn the Malay language. The following
are some of students’ reflections:</p>
<p><em>“I am very glad to be able to participate in the Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme this year, particularly the ‘Dikir Barat’ session! It brought my classmates from different races together as we co-ordinated our hand movements in unison to sing our own rendition of a classic Hari Raya song. I am proud to be able to expose my classmates to Malay culture and I hope they enjoyed the session as much as I did!”</em> –
Muhammad Erryan Bin Mohamad Faizul, Class 3 Empathy</p>
<p><em>"This year, we had an array of activities for our Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme. There was a booth set up at the canteen that featured Malay traditional Wau painting, traditional games, and a demonstration on making Wayang Kulit puppets as well as making of Roti Jala, which is a Malay delicacy. The highlight of the week was the activity we had on Thursday afternoon when we had the chance to learn the skill of weaving baskets! I also had a chance to learn Silat, the traditional Malay self-defence art. These activities sparked my interest to deepen my knowledge on Malay culture and I look forward to participating in more cultural events in future!"</em> -
Ainin Sofiya Binte Md Kamal, Class 3 Determination</p>
<p><em>"I had the chance to do Wau painting as well as create my own Wayang Kulit character. It was all worth the effort when I saw the product of my creativity. I also had the chance to make my own herbal insect repellent using spices this week. I am very happy to be able to participate in the activities and hope to learn more in next year during our Mother Tongue Programme!"</em> -
Emir Affiq Bin Mohd Azhari, Class 2 Pride</p>
<p>Overall, these activities provided authentic opportunities for all students
to use their Mother Tongue Language and experience the Malay culture and
heritage. Well done to all the participants of the MT Fortnight!</p>
