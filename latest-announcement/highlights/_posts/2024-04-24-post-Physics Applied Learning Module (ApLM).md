<p>In March, our Secondary Three Physics students embarked on an exhilarating
journey into the world of engineering through the Applied Learning Module,
“Building and Controlling Flying Machines”, organised by Republic Polytechnic.
The module offered participants a glimpse into life as an engineering student
at the polytechnic and provided them with a platform to explore, innovate,
and problem-solve.</p>
<p>The three-day module had our students immersed in a dynamic learning environment,
where they engaged a wide range of activities designed to deepen their
understanding of the world of aerospace engineering. Guided by seasoned
educators and industry experts, they learnt about the fundamental principles
of aerodynamics and explored the intricacies of various aircraft flight
control systems. They also experienced the thrill of “flying” using a B747
flight simulator, taking to the virtual skies and piloting the commercial
airliner through simulated flight scenarios. This experience, coupled with
theory lessons by trainers, allowed our students to understand how control
surfaces such as ailerons, elevators, and rudders influence aircraft movement,
as well as uncover the principles behind crucial flight instruments like
altimeters, airspeed indicators, and gyroscopes.</p>
<p>The highlight of the module was the opportunity given to our students
to build and test-fly their own gliders and flying drones! The hands-on
session enabled our young innovators to apply the theoretical knowledge
acquired as well as gain invaluable insights into the design process for
optimal aerodynamic performance and stability.</p>
<p>Overall, the module’s hands-on exploration and immersive experiences have
enabled our students to acquire technical expertise and connect their learning
in the Physics classroom to real-world issues in the field of aviation.
As they continue to grow and explore new learning opportunities, we are
confident that they will carry with them the lessons learnt about the dynamic
world of engineering and innovation.</p>
