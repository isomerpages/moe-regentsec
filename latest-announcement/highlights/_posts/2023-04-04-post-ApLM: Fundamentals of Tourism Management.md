<p>Recently, our Secondary 3 Geography students attended the Applied Learning
Module (ApLM) on Fundamentals of Tourism Management conducted by Ngee Ann
Polytechnic. Students learnt about the various sectors in the tourism industry
through innovative pedagogies, such as team discussions, role-playing,
and examination of case studies.</p>
<p>In addition to talks helmed by lecturers and industry speakers, our students
also toured the scenic paradise Gardens by the Bay and had an immersive
experience at Art Science Museum in this 2-day programme.</p>
<p>Secondary 3 student Dawn Chua shared that she truly enjoyed the module
and learning journeys. She found the programme beneficial as it gave her
the essential information to better guide her in her decision-making regarding
her post-secondary options.</p>
<p>Our students were able to learn more about the tourist profile in Singapore
and the unique ways through which the government has created niche experiences
in tourism-related infrastructure. These unique experiences have provided
our students with opportunities to appreciate Singapore’s ability to thrive
as a tourism hub for locals and tourists alike.</p>
<p>As Mr Nelson Mandela once said, “We must dream and relentlessly pursue
those dreams to realise them.” We are certain that the experience of participating
in ApLM has exposed our students to the myriad of possibilities beyond
post-secondary education, igniting their motivations to pursue their dreams
and shape their future.</p>
