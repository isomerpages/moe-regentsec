<p>To celebrate Limbang’s 10th Anniversary, our Student Leaders dedicated
several weeks to planning, designing, and constructing a wide range of
engaging game booths for the community. Every idea—from canvas painting
to ring toss and even a beanbag knockoutl station—was created completely
from scratch. The councillors also made a conscious effort to use mostly
recycled and repurposed materials, reflecting our commitment to sustainability
and caring for the environment.</p>
<p>On the day of the event, the hard work truly paid off. De La Salle was
filled with laughter, excitement, and the bright smiles of children eagerly
participating in the activities. Their enthusiasm brought each booth to
life and reminded our councillors why service to the community is so meaningful.
Seeing the joy on the participants’ faces made every hour of planning and
preparation worthwhile.</p>
<p>The Student Council and CCA leaders are proud to have contributed to this
milestone celebration, and we look forward to many more opportunities to
serve and connect with our wider community.</p>
