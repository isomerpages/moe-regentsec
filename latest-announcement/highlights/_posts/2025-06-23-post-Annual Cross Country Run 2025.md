<h4>A Run to Remember: Regent Secondary School’s Cross Country 2025</h4>
<p>On the cool morning of Friday, 23 May 2025, over a thousand students and
staff gathered in the school hall, buzzing with anticipation for Regent
Secondary School’s Annual Cross Country Run. The 3.6km route would see
the participants making a loop around the Pang Sua Park Connector. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the early hour, energy crackled in the atmosphere. Students in
brightly coloured class T-shirts clustered in groups, warming up with stretches
and nervous laughter. This year’s edition of the race featured a revamped
Competitive Race category. Students had to meet the qualifying time of
at least a C-Grade for their respective age-groups in the NAPFA Test 2.4km
run to make the cut as competitive runners. This made for a tightly-contested
race as the runners aimed for a Top 20 and possibly even a podium finish!</p>
<p>Teachers marshalled the excited participants towards the starting line
and when the starting horn was blasted, the runners surged forward like
a wave, weaving down the gravel track and leaving a cloud of fine dust
in their wake. The route challenged runners with gentle slopes and muddy
patches, but the cool weather was a welcome companion, keeping spirits
high. Along the way, students and teachers in the Fun Run category mingled
and encouraged one another as they brisk-walked and jogged along the park
connector.</p>
<p>For some, it was a serious race for glory; for others, a joyful jog among
friends. As the finish line drew near, cheers erupted for every runner
crossing it—regardless of speed.</p>
<p>More than just a race, the event was a celebration of perseverance, school
spirit, and community, leaving everyone eagerly awaiting next year’s run.</p>
