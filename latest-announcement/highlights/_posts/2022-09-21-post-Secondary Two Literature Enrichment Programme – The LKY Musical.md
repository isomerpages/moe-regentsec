<p>Literature came alive for our Secondary Two students who attended Singapore
Repertory Theatre’s production of The LKY Musical on 21 September 2022.
Now in its second run, the blockbuster show tells the story of Singapore’s
first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and charts his journey from student
to politician fighting for Singapore’s independence.</p>
<p>There were gasps of awe and delight as our students entered the Sands
Theatre and took in the elaborate sets. They were riveted by the cast’s
impeccable acting and singing and marveled at how music by the live orchestra
helped add to the play’s emotional impact. For many of our students, it
was their first time watching a play, and the experience certainly imbued
them with a greater appreciation of the drama texts that they have been
studying in the Literature classroom. Likewise, it was fascinating to hear
the stories of individuals significant to our nation’s history and to encounter
them beyond the pages of our History textbooks.</p>
<p>The trip to the theatre was undoubtedly a rich learning experience for
our Regenites, and we look forward to the next!</p>
