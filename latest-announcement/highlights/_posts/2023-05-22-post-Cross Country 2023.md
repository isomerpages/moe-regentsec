When Your Legs Get Tired, Run With Your Heart

After a three-year hiatus, our annual Cross-Country Run made a triumphant return this morning!

The early morning rain threatened to put a stop to the race even before it started but our fears were short-lived as the skies cleared and the rays of golden sunlight broke through the clouds. Wave after wave of eager runners made their way from the school hall, across the field and to the starting line at the Pang Sua Park Connector. There was an air of anticipation as the runners inched closer and closer to the starting line, awaiting the blast of the airhorn that signaled the start of the race…and off they went!

The 3.5km route took the runners through different terrain, from gravel, to dirt and onto the Pang Sua Park Connector. While the competitive runners jostled and challenged for the top positions in their respective categories, the fun-runners walked and jogged alongside their friends, teachers and even our Principal and Vice-Principals! It was a rare opportunity for everyone to be outdoors and enjoying the fresh morning air for a change!

For some of us, it was about creating memories with friends and classmates; for others, it was about pushing themselves to their physical limits and achieving their personal bests. Regardless of our motivation, we are all runners and winners today…if you run, you are already a winner. It does not matter how fast you are or how long you run. It does not matter if today is your first attempt at running 3.5km or if you have been running much longer distances. The glory is not in finishing the race but in having the courage to start.

If there is one takeaway from today, it is ‘When your legs get tired, run with your heart’!
