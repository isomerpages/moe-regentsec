<p>Our Secondary 2 students recently embarked on an engaging and educational
Post-Exam Learning Journey to Gardens by the Bay. Stepping beyond the classroom,
they participated in the <em>Race to Sustainability</em> — an annual inter-school
competition that challenges students to explore the wonders of Gardens
by the Bay by solving puzzles and answering questions. This immersive experience
provided students with a unique opportunity to learn about Singapore’s
sustainable practices and discover the rich biodiversity of plants and
animals within the Gardens.</p>

<p>Adding an exciting twist to their journey, the Math and Mother Tongue
departments collaborated to create the <em>Regent Bilingual Math Quest</em>.
This activity encouraged students to apply their mensuration skills to
complete measurement tasks and craft captions in their respective Mother
Tongue languages to describe the captivating attractions they encountered.</p>

<p>As they explored the breathtaking Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, students
engaged in hands-on learning, teamwork, and developed a deeper appreciation
for environmental sustainability. This memorable experience not only made
learning enjoyable but also helped bridge classroom knowledge with real-world
applications.</p>
