<p>In a collaborative effort aimed at enriching students’ understanding of
environmental issues, our English Language, Mathematics, Science, and Geography
departments worked together on an interdisciplinary unit. Through a series
of exciting lessons and hands-on activities, our Secondary One students
learnt more about water sources in Singapore and our water footprint. They
created artefacts like a water filter system, learnt how to calculate their
water use at home, and then represented the data using statistical diagrams.
Engaging class discussions during English Language lessons further underscored
the importance of water conservation. Armed with their newfound knowledge,
students subsequently designed posters advocating for their peers to save
water.</p>

<p>The lessons culminated in an excursion to the Marina Barrage’s Sustainable
Singapore Gallery. Here, students learnt about Singapore’s environmental
sustainability efforts. A highlight of the visit was encountering a life-sized
replica of Singapore’s Deep Tunnel Sewerage System, which is used to transport
used water via gravity to three different water reclamation plants across
the island. Students also enjoyed themselves immensely during “Race to
Net Zero”, an interactive activity aimed at encouraging visitors to actively
participate in sustainable practices in the community. An arts and crafts
session further demonstrated the power of upcycling, with students transforming
banner strips into practical cup holders. This hands-on experience allowed
participants to grasp the need for repurposing materials to minimise waste
and imbued in them a sense of environmental stewardship.</p>

<p>Armed with their beautifully-designed cup holders and a renewed commitment
to water conservation, our students returned home inspired to enact positive
change in their communities. This interdisciplinary initiative has not
only deepened Regenites’ understanding of environmental issues but also
empowered them to become advocates for a more sustainable future.</p>
