<h4>Authentic Learning in Action: POA Students Explore Business Concepts at JEM and Westgate</h4>
<p>As part of our commitment to authentic, hands-on learning, the Secondary
Three Principles of Accounts (POA) students recently participated in an
insightful learning journey to JEM and Westgate malls. This experiential
outing provided students with the opportunity to explore how accounting
principles are applied in real-world business settings.</p>
<p>During the visit, students were grouped and guided through an interactive
Padlet activity that featured thought-provoking questions designed to reinforce
and extend classroom knowledge. As they explored the malls, they examined
both trading and service-based businesses, linking their observations to
core POA concepts.</p>
<p>At retail outlets such as Cotton On and IKEA, students learned how businesses
source goods from suppliers and resell them for profit. They observed how
inventory is managed, and how pricing strategies—including the use of discounts—play
a crucial role in increasing revenue.</p>
<p>Students also visited service-oriented businesses like hair salons and
orthopaedic clinics, where they saw first-hand how these enterprises operate
differently from trading businesses. They noted that service businesses
provide intangible products and often invest in long-term, non-current
assets such as mirrors, benches, and equipment—resources that support daily
operations but are not for sale.</p>
<p>In a meaningful collaboration with the Mathematics Department, this year's
learning journey also introduced students to the concept of compound interest.
By integrating mathematical calculations into their business observations,
students saw how financial literacy and numeracy intersect in real-world
scenarios.</p>
<p>This enriching learning journey provided students with a deeper understanding
of key business concepts and distinctions, such as the differences between
trading and service businesses, inventory management, and the types of
assets businesses use. More importantly, it allowed them to see how the
subjects they study have practical, real-life applications—laying a solid
foundation for their future studies and potential careers in accounting
and finance.</p>
