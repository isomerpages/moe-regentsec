<p>10 May 2024 was a momentous occasion for our National Police Cadet Corps
(NPCC) and Red Cross Youth (RCY) units, who came together to mark NPCC
Day and World Red Cross Day with a joint parade.</p>

<p>With their unit flags flying high, our NPCC and RCY cadets reaffirmed
their commitment to serving the country and community with utmost dedication.
It was also a proud moment for our Secondary One cadets, who were participating
in a parade for the very first time—and to a live audience, no less. ‘I
enjoyed being a part of the parade. Commemorating NPCC Day with my CCA
mates allowed me to reflect on my time in the unit thus far and reaffirm
my commitment to giving my best during our training sessions,’ notes NPCC
cadet Asher Lim (S1-Integrity).</p>

<p>Indeed, our boys and girls in uniform demonstrated much spirit and fortitude,
putting up a fine display of esprit de corps as one Uniformed Group fraternity
at the event.</p>
