> “Music is the universal language. It brings people closer together.” - Ella Fitzgerald

The Multi Racial Mass Drum workshop served to introduce students to different types of percussion instruments. Our entire Secondary 2 cohort students had the privilege to come together to learn and play percussion instruments from different ethnic and cultures.
It was a delight for our students to get the opportunity to explore the wide variety of instruments from the percussion family. The interactions between the instructors and students generated much fun and laughter, and Regenites definitely enjoyed being able to play loud rhythms on the percussion of their choice!

Students were also given the autonomy to create their own rhythm as a class and put them together as a cohort. It was a feat for many Regenites but we were really heartened to see them rising to the occasion, with many students coming forward to lead.
