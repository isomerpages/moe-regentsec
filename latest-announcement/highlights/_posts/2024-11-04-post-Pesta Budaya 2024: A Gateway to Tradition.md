<p>At the heart of Woodlands Civic Centre, Regent Secondary School students
proudly hosted a captivating booth during Pesta Budaya 2024—a celebration
of Malay traditional games. Dressed in traditional Malay attire, they warmly
welcomed visitors, inviting them to experience a slice of heritage. Their
booth, adorned with nostalgic motifs, attracted curious onlookers. Here,
‘gasing’ were spun, ‘congkak seeds’ were counted, and ‘capteh’ floated
in the air, defying gravity. But this wasn’t just play; it was an educational
journey into the origins, meanings, and life lessons embedded in each game.</p>
<p>Senior Minister of State Mr. Zaqy Mohamed visited the booth, his presence
bridging generations. The students, both nervous and proud, explained their
mission: to rekindle interest, honour their roots, and pass on their heritage.
Through these games, they sowed seeds of appreciation and continuity, showing
that these weren’t just relics of the past—they were vessels of wisdom,
resilience, and joy.</p>
<p>As the event drew to a close, the students reflected on their success.
They had met their goals: raising awareness, showcasing the significance
of these games, and planting hope for the future. They envisioned children
laughing, elders reminiscing and the sounds of marbles echoing through
time. In that sunlit corner, the past came alive alongside the present.
And the students carried forward a legacy—one that whispered, “Play on,
for our culture lives within you.”</p>
