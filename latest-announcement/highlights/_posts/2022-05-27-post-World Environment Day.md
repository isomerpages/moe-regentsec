<p>World Environment Day falls on 5th June 2022. To commemorate this momentous
day and do our part for Mother Earth, Regent held an Environment Week starting
from 23 to 27 May!</p>
<p><strong>Student Collaboration</strong>
</p>
<p>Several CCAs came onboard to contribute with the common goal of advocating
for changes we can make by tweaking our lifestyle. Students from the Show
Choir came up with their very own music jiggle to spread environmental
messages while our Drama Club collaborated with InfoComm Club and produced
2 videos on reducing carbon footprint in and outside of school. The Robotics
Club made use of Blockie to design a structure to house potted plants and
coded a device to monitor the humidity of the plants. Our Student Council
is partnering with Northwest CDC to conduct an online zoom workshop for
Yew Tee residents on the fundamentals of 5Rs and to share tips on how to
upcycle old clothes into tote bags.</p>
<p><strong>Showcase Boards</strong>
</p>
<p>To reach out to our student population, our Environmental Sciences Club
put display boards showcasing ways to recycle right and share information
on the nature of biodiversity in school and Singapore at large. Through
this, students learnt the names of the common birds sighted in school.
Together with the Class Environment Champions, students also had the chance
to try out hands-on activities like upcycling empty plastic bottles into
zipper containers and folding paper box origami which can be used to place
their items or waste.</p>
<p>All of us can play a part to protect our Earth by making changes to our
lifestyle habits. We hope every Regenite would take on the role as Mother
Earthâ€™s ambassadors and spread the message of environmental conservation
messages to people around us!</p>
