<p>The Cross Country Run, held on 17 May 2024, was the first mass-participation
sports event of the year for our students, and it was nothing short of
electrifying. With students primed and pumped for the run—many with aspirations
of clinching a highly-coveted top-20 position in the Upper and Lower Secondary
Boys and Girls race categories—the atmosphere crackled with anticipation.
Adding to the excitement was the fact that Challenge Shields would be awarded
to the top class of each level, and this fuelled the fervour amongst runners
to help propel their class to glorious victory.</p>

<p>The week leading up to race day had been rainy and wet, and we were all
wishing for clear skies and our wishes were granted. As the golden rays
of sunlight broke through the clouds, wave after wave of eager runners
made their way from the school hall to converge at the starting line along
the Pang Sua Park Connector. Anticipation hung palpably in the air as runners
edged closer, poised for the momentous blast of the airhorn signalling
the commencement of the race. And then, they were off!</p>
<p>The 3.6km route took runners across different types of terrain, from gravel
paths to dirt tracks and onto the concrete pavements of the park connector.
While our competitive runners jostled and gunned for the top spot in their
respective race categories, camaraderie reigned supreme amongst our fun-runners
who walked and jogged alongside their friends and teachers. Even superheroes
Iron Man and Captain America momentarily set aside their world-saving duties
to join in the exhilarating run, underscoring the rare opportunity it was
for everyone to be out-of-doors that day, basking in the sun and the crisp
morning air.</p>

<p>For some, the run was about creating new memories with friends and classmates.
For others, it was about pushing themselves to the limit and attaining
new milestones. Regardless of their individual motivations, it is safe
to say that our Regenites were all runners and winners that day. For in
the realm of running, every stride embodies victory; every participant,
a winner. Whether one sprints at lightning speed or opts for a more leisurely
pace, whether a novice embarking on their inaugural race or a seasoned
marathoner, the essence of triumph lies not merely in finishing the race,
but in having the courage to start.</p>
<p>If there is one message to glean from the day’s exhilarating events, it
is this:</p>
<h4>‘When your legs get tired, run with your heart!’</h4>
