Science came alive for our Secondary One students during their Learning Journey to the Science Centre!
 
Equipped with activity booklets to guide them through the two Gallery Pathways, our students were in for an adventure! While having fun, Regenites were able to extend their learning on the Ray model of Light taught in Secondary 1 and at the same time, explore themes of Energy which will only be taught in Secondary 2.
 
The free and easy exploration session of the Science Centre proved to be a hit among the students as they explored different exhibits. Regenites also immersed themselves in a reality gameplay as they navigated their way through the Mirror Maze.
 
We were also fortunate to catch the Energy Titan's show, where we were treated to exciting demonstrations regarding electricity.
 
Student Muhammad Hardy Haider from 1-Gratitude remarked, “I love the different exhibits! It definitely made me interested to explore and learn more about science!”
 
It is safe to say that Regenites definitely had a thrilling and electrifying learning experience at the Science Centre!
