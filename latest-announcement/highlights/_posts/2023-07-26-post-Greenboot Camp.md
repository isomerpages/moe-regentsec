Amidst the growing interest in environmental sustainability, a dedicated group of students from Environmental Science participated in the Green Bootcamp @ North West. This 3-day programme aims to engage and empower youths to come up with innovative green solutions for various environmental issues.

Regenites had the opportunity to hear from diverse community partners and subject experts, such as Climate Fresk and Project Lato. They also had the opportunity to explore how human activities contributed to a detrimental chain effect on our environment through engaging card games.

Students also got to know more about sustainability efforts helmed by Tzu Chi Foundation during a guided tour of the organisation.  This interactive session provided them with opportunities to clarify their doubts on various aspects of environmental sustainability with volunteers who kindly shared their unique experiences in conservation efforts. By the end of the session, students recognised the different ways to incorporate environmental sustainability into their daily activities.

Regenites also had the privilege of attending an upcycling workshop conducted by Semula-Asia, one of the pioneering plastic recycling companies in Singapore. In this hands-on session, students received recycled plastic materials and transformed them into useful products of their choice. Through the guidance provided by the helpful instructors, each student brought home their individualised upcycled product, such as stationary holders and paper holders.

On the final day of the workshop, our students worked together to come up with innovative solutions to tackle food waste in Singapore, before pitching their ideas to a panel of judges. Not only were our students required to deliver their proposal eloquently and concisely, but they had to also address the judges' impromptu inquiries. This was a test of their courage and confidence, and we are glad to see our students stand strong against these challenges!

Emerging victorious is not our main reason for joining the Bootcamp, but it is the cherry on top!

We are immensely honoured and proud to announce that our students emerged first in the competition! Well done fellow Regenites! We look forward to seeing you soar to greater heights!
