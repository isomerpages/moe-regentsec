In this semester, our Secondary Three students underwent a Leadership workshop to prepare them to lead and plan for their Values-In-Action project. The Leadership workshop was facilitated by affable instructors who provided the students with the training to enhance and hone their leadership and planning skills.

Nicole Claire Matthew Lim from 3-Determination reflected on her learning experiences: We embarked on many different challenges during this workshop. For example, we had a "39 minute to win it" competition between classes. We had different obstacles and challenges to overcome, such as building dominoes within a time limit, and also a team hula hoop challenge where we all have to interlock hands and pass through the hoops one by one within a time limit. The most arduous challenge my group and I faced was “Skipping rope challenge”. We were tasked to have five people jumping over a rope with a minimum target of 15 skips, while another two coordinate the swinging of the rope. This activity really challenged our communication skills because we had to ensure that everyone jumped at the right timing. Yet it was precisely this challenge that enabled us to have a stronger team spirit, especially when we enthusiastically cheered each other on. With the feeling of accomplishing our task successfully, I can safely say that this has strengthened our bonds, which is beneficial for us to come together as a team to execute a project.

With all these soft skills that we have learnt, I find that the application of these skills would really benefit us in our VIA project planning. My class hopes to have the confidence to execute this project successfully at the end of Term 2, sharing joy and love to our community.
