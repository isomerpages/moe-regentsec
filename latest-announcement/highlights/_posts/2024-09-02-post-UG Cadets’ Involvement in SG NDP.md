<p>Our Regenites dazzled at this year’s National Day Parade, with Ng Han
Siang Lucas (2-Pride), Teo Chun Kai Bosco (3-Determination), and Joel Chong
En Wei (3-Empathy) from the Boys’ Brigade (BB) as well as Red Cross Youth
(RCY) cadets Nur Faaiqah Binte Junaidi (3-Determination) and Wendy Heng
Wan Xin (3-Integrity) marching with their Uniformed Group contingents in
the NDP 2024 Parade and Ceremony Segment.</p>
<p>Months of intense training culminated in a display of exceptional skill
and teamwork. From perfecting their foot drills to networking with fellow
parade participants and meeting dignitaries at the National Education (NE)
Show, our cadets were at the heart of the action! As BB boy Bosco, a two-time
parade participant, shared: ‘Meeting new friends and people from different
contingents was an incredible experience! I’m glad I chose to step up and
seize the opportunity to represent my school and CCA.</p>

<p>For RCY cadet Wendy, the parade was a testament to the values of discipline
and commitment. ‘Sacrificing so many Saturdays to train for the parade
was no mean feat, but it was worth it.’ Faaiqah echoed the sentiment of
hard work and dedication. ‘I’ve learnt that hard work and consistent effort
are crucial. Without these, the parade wouldn’t have come together as smoothly.’</p>

National Day 2024 a memorable celebration of perseverance and unity!</p>
