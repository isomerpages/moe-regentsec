<h4>Celebrating Diversity and Connection: International Friendship Day 2025</h4>
<p>To commemorate International Friendship Day (IFD), Regent Secondary launched
a vibrant series of activities from 14 to 16 April, centred around the
theme <em>“</em>Forging Friendships in a Complex World.” The events highlighted
the importance of building meaningful connections and embracing diversity
in an increasingly interconnected society.</p>

<p>Students began the week with the IFD Regent Rave and in-class engagement
sessions. International students and NE Ambassadors took the lead, sharing
their personal stories and insights on cultural diversity, sparking conversations
about cross-cultural understanding.</p>
<p>Building on these meaningful exchanges, students were next treated to
a musical celebration of cultural unity through a live performance by a
4-piece band from Hummingbird Music. The band played iconic songs from
across ASEAN, including Getaran Jiwa (Malaysia), Sabaaai Sabaaai (Thailand),
Khong (Vietnam), and Anak (Philippines). The captivating performances gave
students a chance to see how music transcends borders and fosters cultural
appreciation. As one student, Zhi Le, shared, the commemorative events
reinforced “how essential it is to create an inclusive, respectful environment.”</p>

<p>The week concluded with CCE lessons focused on the theme of openness.
Lower Secondary students explored openness through gallery walks and reflected
on its meaning at personal, community, and national levels. Meanwhile,
Upper Secondary students used a four-point compass framework to examine
the value of staying open-minded in a changing world.</p>
<p>Across the week, students embraced the opportunity to celebrate the diverse
backgrounds that make up the Regent community. The events left a lasting
impression, reminding us that even small acts of openness and understanding
can help forge strong friendships in a complex world.</p>
