<p>Our Regenites commemorated International Friendship Day on 8 April, and
a myriad of activities was organized throughout the week for students to
understand the importance of good relations between friends and countries.</p>
<p>At the start of the week, our Principal set the context for Regenites
to understand how the conflict in Ukraine could affect Singapore and our
sovereignty. Students continued to delve deeper into the topic during CCE
lessons by discussing how the war had impacted the people of Ukraine as
well as how the international community has responded to the conflict.
This deepened our understanding of Singaporeâ€™s realities as a small state
and the importance of safeguarding our national interests. Students also
took part in an exciting inter-class competition, where they designed posters
to encapsulate their key takeaways from International Friendship Day.</p>
<p>In addition, students also had the chance to listen to how strong friendships
have been forged between Regenites of different nationalities. Our international
student, Kim Huiyeon (2-Gratitude) shared about her experience growing
up in Korea and how she has adapted to life in Singapore. Her Singaporean
classmate, Lee Xin Yan Richelle, shared how she and Huiyeon have strengthened
their friendship through common interests.</p>
<p>Our NE Ambassadors also led their classmates to facilitate an engaging
activity to learn more about the significance of international friendships.
Designed with the principles of Differentiated Instruction, students moved
around three Learning Stations set up in the classrooms to access various
interactive and rich texts. Students watched interesting videos, read insightful
articles from the special IN Edition, and took part in Kahoot quizzes.</p>
<p>Overall, our students had a blast learning about International Friendship
Day whilst promoting the spirit of friendship and collaboration. All of
us have an active role in fostering people-to-people ties and celebrate
the region's diversity and vibrancy!</p>
