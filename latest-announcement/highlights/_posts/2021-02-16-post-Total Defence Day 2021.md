<p>Over the course of the past two weeks, Regent Secondary School commemorated
Total Defence Day 2021. Some of the activities that our students were involved
in include a pop-up display showing the Total Defence Puzzle, which showcases
the many items that the public can do to put Total Defence in action. Our
Uniformed Groups cadets also came into action, conducting lessons which
imbue skills and knowledge such as First Aid to the whole school, as well
as putting up a parade to demonstrate their commitment to Total Defence.
Students in school were also involved in the “Find the Suspicious Package”
Activity, which aimed to hone students’ vigilance in looking out for dubious
items which looked out of place. To cap off the whole series of activities,
the school invited several veteran SAF soldiers and NSmen to share their
experiences with the school via Zoom. These engaging speakers took the
opportunity to impart valuable lessons about how Total Defence can aid
Singapore in its fight against Covid-19, as well as how National Service
serves as a strong pillar of defence for Singapore. Overall, these whole
suite of activities served to educate our students about Total Defence,
and how “Together, we keep Singapore strong!”</p>
