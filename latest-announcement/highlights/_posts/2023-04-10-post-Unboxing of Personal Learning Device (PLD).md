A buzz of excitement filled the air as our Secondary 1 students received their Chromebooks on 6 April! A key initiative of National Digital Literacy Programme, these Personal Learning Devices will help enhance teaching and learning in the classroom, support self-directed and collaborative learning, and sharpen our students’ digital literacy skills.

As our students eagerly “unboxed” their devices, our teachers and staff from the IT department were on hand to guide them through the setup process. The day ended off with all students pledging to care for and utilise their devices judiciously, and to be responsible users of the Internet.

We can’t wait to see what lies in store for our future-ready learners at Regent!
