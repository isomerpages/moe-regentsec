<p>In September this year, our Secondary 1 students embarked on an unforgettable
four-day, three-night adventure at the MOE Changi Coast Outdoor Adventure
Learning Centre. The camp was designed to challenge their limits, build
resilience, and strengthen friendships while having plenty of fun in the
great outdoors!</p>
<p>From paddling across open waters during kayaking to conquering towering
rock walls and high-element courses, students faced each challenge with
courage and determination. Abseiling tested their trust and focus, while
outdoor cooking sessions brought out their teamwork and creativity as they
whipped up simple but hearty meals together.</p>

<p>One of the camp’s highlights was the full-day land expedition around East
Coast Park and the Siglap area. Trekking along the scenic coastline, students
encouraged one another and discovered the value of teamwork and perseverance
through every step of the journey.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the thrilling kayaking activity and I also got a chance to
forge new friendships with students from other classes,” shared Brandon
Ng from 1 Pride, a sentiment echoed by many who left the camp with lasting
memories and newfound confidence.</p>

<p>Beyond the physical challenges, the camp nurtured the values of resilience,
responsibility, and respect, hallmarks of the Regent spirit. As the camp
drew to a close on 18 September, students returned to school with stronger
bonds, greater self-belief, and a deeper sense of belonging. The Secondary
1 Cohort Camp was truly more than an adventure. It was a journey of growth,
courage, and friendship!</p>
