We are pleased to announce that our National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) unit has attained the Unit Overall Proficiency Award (Distinction) for the year 2022!

The UOPA is awarded to school units each year to promote excellence and proficiency at all levels, and the Distinction award is the highest possible honour a unit may attain. Thanks to the work of its cadets, teachers, and volunteer officers, Regentâ€™s NPCC unit has been able to uphold its exceptional track record of robust and spirited training sessions.

2022 saw NPCC cadets participating in various modules and competitions, and the loosening of restrictions also allowed for the resumption of out-of-school activities such as the Dragon Boating Sport Enrichment Programme, Air Pistol Course, and visits to the Singapore Discovery Centre. This year, our cadets can look forward to taking part in a slew of activities that were shelved during the pandemic! These include Camp Resilience at Pulau Ubin and an exciting learning journey to the K-9 unit.

We are grateful for the support of all our stakeholders and may Regent continue to blaze forth to glory
