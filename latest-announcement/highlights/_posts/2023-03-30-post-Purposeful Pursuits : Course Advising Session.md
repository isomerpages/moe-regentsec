The Course Advising session held at Nanyang Polytechnic on 27 March 2023 had strengthened the Secondary Four & Five students’ resolve to achieve their aspirations. As the students set their sights on their dream post-secondary institutions and course, the session had given them insights about polytechnic experiences and the needs of the future industries. Students had a wonderful opportunity to interact with the polytechnic lecturers in-person. The interactions had also enlightened our students about whether the courses would suit their strengths and interests. Lee Jialu from 4-Determination shared that the sessions conducted by the Polytechnic lecturers were very informative and she has gained a better understanding of the various career pathways. This experience would definitely spur our students to realise their dreams and goals in this final lap of their secondary education.
