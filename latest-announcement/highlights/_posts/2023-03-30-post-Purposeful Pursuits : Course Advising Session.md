<p>The Course Advising session held at Nanyang Polytechnic on 27 March 2023
had strengthened the Secondary Four &amp; Five studentsâ€™ resolve to achieve
their aspirations. As the students set their sights on their dream post-secondary
institutions and course, the session had given them insights about polytechnic
experiences and the needs of the future industries. Students had a wonderful
opportunity to interact with the polytechnic lecturers in-person. The interactions
had also enlightened our students about whether the courses would suit
their strengths and interests. Lee Jialu from 4-Determination shared that
the sessions conducted by the Polytechnic lecturers were very informative
and she has gained a better understanding of the various career pathways.
This experience would definitely spur our students to realise their dreams
and goals in this final lap of their secondary education.</p>
