<p>Regent came together to commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21 July, and
it was a day where our students reflected on and celebrated Singapore as
a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures.</p>
<p>‘Multicultural Mosaic’ is the theme for 2022, and it aptly reflects how
each community, while having the space to express its own identity, intertwines
with others to create the unique cultural diversity that characterises
Singapore life. To bring this theme alive, we had an inter-class competition
where our students drew beautiful mosaics that showcased the richness of
our culture with food, costumes, festivals, and traditional entertainment
galore!</p>
<p>The hall too was a sea of colours as our students gathered for the Racial
Harmony Day Concert. To mark the occasion, many donned traditional costumes
such as the baju kurung, cheongsam, and sari, and they took pride in explaining
the significance of their attire to their peers. The school was abuzz with
excitement as our lively student emcees took the stage and shared interesting
tidbits about the various festivals celebrated in Singapore. English Drama
also put up a meaningful performance about how our forefathers had to navigate
changes and learn to work with different groups to make Singapore a prosperous
place.</p>
<p>For student Lim Xin Tong (1-Empathy), the highlight of the concert was
seeing Regent Pop Band perform a medley of songs in Malay and Mandarin.
The performance served as a reminder that we can enjoy and appreciate music
and entertainment from many different cultures in Singapore.</p>
<p>Finally, our students continued discussing the issue of race during their
weekly CCE lessons, where they reflected on their personal experiences.
Newspaper articles were also used as a springboard to discuss contemporary
events pertaining to the topic.</p>
<p>Celebrating Racial Harmony Day 2022 was a poignant reminder that all of
us play a critical role in maintaining social cohesion in Singapore.</p>
