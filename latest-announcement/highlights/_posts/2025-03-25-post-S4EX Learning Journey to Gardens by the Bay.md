<h4>Geographers in Action: Exploring Tourism at Gardens by the Bay</h4>
<p>Geography comes alive when students step beyond the classroom and into
the real world. Our Secondary 4 and 5 Geography students recently embarked
on an enriching fieldwork study at Gardens by the Bay, applying their knowledge
and skills to investigate real-world tourism dynamics. As part of the Humanities
Department’s initiative to enhance experiential learning, this hands-on
exercise allowed students to connect theory with practice in a meaningful
way.</p>
<p>The main objective of the field trip was to deepen students' understanding
of tourism-related geographical phenomena through fieldwork techniques
and data collection methods. Working in teams, students conducted on-site
surveys and interviews with visitors and tourists, assessing their hypotheses
and gathering valuable insights into Singapore’s tourism landscape.</p>
<p>This immersive experience not only strengthened their analytical and critical
thinking skills but also helped them see Geography beyond the textbook.
By engaging directly with tourists, students gained firsthand knowledge
of visitor experiences, preferences, and perceptions of Gardens by the
Bay.</p>

<p>Jovan Lim shared his experience: “<em>Overall, it was an eye-opening experience. Stationed at the entrance of Gardens by the Bay South, my group and I managed to interview 10 people regarding their feedback on the enthralling gardens as they stepped in. I enjoyed interacting with them to facilitate the feedback collection</em>.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Wendy Heng reflected: “<em>The Geography fieldwork exercise at Gardens by the Bay was an enlightening experience. We had the chance to be stationed at four different locations to interview tourists about their experiences there. During this process, we tested our survey and identified its limitations. I conducted the survey and noted its shortcomings. Overall, visiting Gardens by the Bay and engaging in real-world data collection provided valuable insights.</em>”</p>
<p>Through this fieldwork experience, students not only honed their geographical
research skills but also gained a deeper appreciation for the impact of
tourism in Singapore. This trip exemplified the power of experiential learning,
bringing Geography to life and preparing students to think like true geographers—curious,
analytical, and engaged with the world around them.</p>
