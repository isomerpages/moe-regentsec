I have a dream…

Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for the country…

These are all memorable lines from enduring speeches from famous US leaders of the 20th Century. 

In Regent Secondary School, we believe that public speaking is an important communication skill that all leaders should possess. Thus, it is a key skill that we wish to impart through our IGNITE Sec 2 Cohort Leadership Workshops. Through the workshops, the Sec 2 students will have the opportunity to hone their oratory skills and work in teams with their classmates as they work towards the end goal of crafting and planning their Class VIA project.
