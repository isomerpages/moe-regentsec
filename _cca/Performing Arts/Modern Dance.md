One of the most famous lines in the film ‚ÄòRatatouille‚Äô is that ‚Äòanyone can cook‚Äô. In Regent Modern Dance, we believe that anyone can dance. This is why we welcome anyone who is interested in dance and challenge each member to reach their personal goals in their performing arts journey.¬†

As part of the Regent Modern Dance holistic experience, our students are exposed to a variety of dance genres, from contemporary to hip hop, and cultural dances to kpop. Our students experience what it is like to develop and grow as a team through rigorous training and bonding games, and learn about leadership through VIA projects and handing-over-taking-over ceremonies. Students are given opportunities to perform at a school, community and national level, including Cultural Night (2018), Yew Tee CC National Day Dinner (2018) and the SYF Arts Presentation (2021), where we were awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment. Modern Dance also believes in giving back to society through our VIA programme. Over the past few years, we have carried out student-run VIA projects at the Botanical Gardens, Fei Yue‚Äôs Senior Activity Centre at Limbang, and MWS Nursing Home.

While we emphasise on appreciation of the arts in our CCA, we also instill important values in our students such as resilience and camaraderie. We map our dance goals, our highs and lows and our journey together as one team.

With the support of our school leaders, teachers-in-charge, and resident choreographer and instructor from EV Dance, Modern Dance looks forward to growing in strength and developing confident students by providing its members with various avenues to lead, learn and perform.

In Regent Modern Dance, we truly believe that anyone can dance. It is not talent, but sheer determination and passion, that shines on stage.

As our motto so aptly goes,¬†_‚ÄúDance with your heart, and your feet will follow‚Äù._
