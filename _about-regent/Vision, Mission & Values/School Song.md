Lyrics by Mrs Aslinah Shariff & Mr Gerard Nonis

Hear the echoes of Regent,  
Reaching far and wide.  
With diligence and pride,  
We’ll make our mark.  
Meeting all the challenges  
that come in our stride,  
We will cherish our values,  
We live with grace,  
Striving for a future that’s ours to embrace.  
Regent echoes in dignity.  
With an undaunting spirit we’ll do our best.  
One voice, one mind,  
One voice, one mind,  
We will blaze forth to glory.

True to our flaming spirit,  
With blazing determination,  
With love, honour and might,  
We will serve our school and nation.  
With one voice, one mind,  
With one voice, one mind,  
We will blaze forth to glory.  
Regent echoes in dignity.  
With an undaunting spirit we’ll do our best.  
With one voice, one mind,  
With one voice, one mind  
We will blaze forth to glory.
