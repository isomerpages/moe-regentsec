### **SMART Nation Builder Truck Visit**

The truck is here!
 
The Smart Nation Builder, a roving truck which showcases Singapore's digitalisation initiatives, visited Regent Secondary School on 24 and 25 May 2022. Our students were excited to be a part of this experience and eagerly climbed aboard the truck to try their hand at the various interactive exhibits on display. There were game stations for participants to learn more about Singapore's tech initiatives—such as the LifeSG app—and even a delightful claw machine!
 
The visit certainly helped enhance our students' understanding of Singapore's fast-evolving technological landscape and how tech may be used to better engage citizens.
