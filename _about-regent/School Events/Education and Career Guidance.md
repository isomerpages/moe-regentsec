<h2>TAC: The Astronaut Collective</h2>
<p>Our Secondary Two students recently participated in the Astronaut Collective
programme, an engaging initiative designed to help them explore potential
career pathways and reflect on their aspirations in various industries.</p>
<p>The programme began with icebreaker activities, fostering camaraderie
among participants. Students then listened to inspiring speakers who delved
into the concept of "worlds of work" and introduced the diverse range of
job tasters available. These sessions provided a broad perspective on the
opportunities awaiting them in the working world.</p>

<p>In the second part of the programme, students selected two pre-curated
job tasters that aligned with their interests. This hands-on approach allowed
them to gain deeper insights into specific industries, equipping them with
valuable knowledge to make informed decisions about their futures. Facilitators
also addressed students' queries about the Singapore job market, ensuring
a comprehensive understanding of current trends and opportunities.</p>
<p>The Astronaut Collective programme not only introduced students to potential
career options but also provided guidance on selecting post-secondary educational
courses in related disciplines. It emphasised the importance of self-awareness,
goal setting, and aligning personal strengths with career aspirations.</p>

<h2>Purposeful Pursuits - Course Advising Session</h2>
<p>The Course Advising session held at Nanyang Polytechnic on 27 March 2023
had strengthened the Secondary Four &amp; Five students’ resolve to achieve
their aspirations. As the students set their sights on their dream post-secondary
institutions and course, the session had given them insights about polytechnic
experiences and the needs of the future industries. Students had a wonderful
opportunity to interact with the polytechnic lecturers in-person. The interactions
had also enlightened our students about whether the courses would suit
their strengths and interests. Lee Jialu from 4-Determination shared that
the sessions conducted by the Polytechnic lecturers were very informative
and she has gained a better understanding of the various career pathways.
This experience would definitely spur our students to realise their dreams
and goals in this final lap of their secondary education.</p>
