<h2><strong>TAC: The Astronaut Collective</strong></h2>
<p>Our Secondary Two students recently participated in the Astronaut Collective
programme, an engaging initiative designed to help them explore potential
career pathways and reflect on their aspirations in various industries.</p>
<p>The programme began with icebreaker activities, fostering camaraderie
among participants. Students then listened to inspiring speakers who delved
into the concept of "worlds of work" and introduced the diverse range of
job tasters available. These sessions provided a broad perspective on the
opportunities awaiting them in the working world.</p>

<p>In the second part of the programme, students selected two pre-curated
job tasters that aligned with their interests. This hands-on approach allowed
them to gain deeper insights into specific industries, equipping them with
valuable knowledge to make informed decisions about their futures. Facilitators
also addressed students' queries about the Singapore job market, ensuring
a comprehensive understanding of current trends and opportunities.</p>
<p>The Astronaut Collective programme not only introduced students to potential
career options but also provided guidance on selecting post-secondary educational
courses in related disciplines. It emphasised the importance of self-awareness,
goal setting, and aligning personal strengths with career aspirations.</p>
