<h2><strong>S4EX Learning Journey to Gardens by the Bay</strong></h2>
<h4>Geographers in Action: Exploring Tourism at Gardens by the Bay</h4>
<p>Geography comes alive when students step beyond the classroom and into
the real world. Our Secondary 4 and 5 Geography students recently embarked
on an enriching fieldwork study at Gardens by the Bay, applying their knowledge
and skills to investigate real-world tourism dynamics. As part of the Humanities
Department’s initiative to enhance experiential learning, this hands-on
exercise allowed students to connect theory with practice in a meaningful
way.</p>
<p>The main objective of the field trip was to deepen students' understanding
of tourism-related geographical phenomena through fieldwork techniques
and data collection methods. Working in teams, students conducted on-site
surveys and interviews with visitors and tourists, assessing their hypotheses
and gathering valuable insights into Singapore’s tourism landscape.</p>
<p>This immersive experience not only strengthened their analytical and critical
thinking skills but also helped them see Geography beyond the textbook.
By engaging directly with tourists, students gained firsthand knowledge
of visitor experiences, preferences, and perceptions of Gardens by the
Bay.</p>

<p>Jovan Lim shared his experience: “<em>Overall, it was an eye-opening experience. Stationed at the entrance of Gardens by the Bay South, my group and I managed to interview 10 people regarding their feedback on the enthralling gardens as they stepped in. I enjoyed interacting with them to facilitate the feedback collection</em>.”</p>
<p>Similarly, Wendy Heng reflected: “<em>The Geography fieldwork exercise at Gardens by the Bay was an enlightening experience. We had the chance to be stationed at four different locations to interview tourists about their experiences there. During this process, we tested our survey and identified its limitations. I conducted the survey and noted its shortcomings. Overall, visiting Gardens by the Bay and engaging in real-world data collection provided valuable insights.</em>”</p>
<p>Through this fieldwork experience, students not only honed their geographical
research skills but also gained a deeper appreciation for the impact of
tourism in Singapore. This trip exemplified the power of experiential learning,
bringing Geography to life and preparing students to think like true geographers—curious,
analytical, and engaged with the world around them.</p>

<h2><strong>S4EX NUS Geography Challenge</strong></h2>
<h4>NUS Geographical Challenge 2025: Expanding Knowledge Beyond the Classroom</h4>
<p>Where knowledge meets action—geography in motion! The NUS Geographical
Challenge 2025 brought together passionate geography students in a test
of knowledge, analytical thinking, and teamwork. The prestigious competition
saw participants pushing their boundaries beyond textbook learning, applying
their understanding to real-world challenges.</p>
<p>Covering a range of topics from sustainability to climate change and global
issues, the challenge required students to think critically and propose
solutions to pressing global concerns. Through rigorous individual and
group components, participants demonstrated not just their grasp of geographical
concepts but also their ability to analyse data and collaborate effectively.
The individual component tested students' independence in decision-making,
while the group component emphasized teamwork and strategic thinking. Engaging
in spirited discussions and dynamic problem-solving, participants gained
fresh insights into contemporary geographical issues.</p>
<p>Beyond the competition, the experience was immensely enriching. Students
left with a deeper appreciation for geography—not just as an academic subject,
but as a discipline that influences global policies, sustainability efforts,
and societal development. More importantly, the event provided a platform
for like-minded students to connect, exchange ideas, and cultivate a shared
passion for making a difference in the world.</p>
<p>For many, the team component was the highlight of the event. Angel Lim
Li Yu shared, “It was fun to see everyone working together at the lecture
theatre, discussing and having fun. Personally, I enjoyed the team component
the most as I was able to collaborate with my groupmates.” Chuan Jia Ning
Ashlyn echoed similar sentiments, saying, “The team component was the most
memorable as I got to hear many creative ideas from my peers.”</p>
<p>The NUS Geographical Challenge 2025 was more than just a test of knowledge—it
was a celebration of intellectual curiosity, teamwork, and the real-world
application of geographical concepts. Participants walked away not just
with new knowledge, but also with confidence, inspiration, and a renewed
appreciation for geography’s role in shaping the world.</p>
