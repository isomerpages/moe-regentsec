<h2><strong>NUS Geography Challenge</strong></h2>
<p>The National University of Singapore (NUS) Geography Challenge, organised
by the NUS Department of Geography and NUS Geographical Society, is an
annual competition open to students from secondary schools across Singapore.
“Urban Odyssey: Rediscovering our Landscapes and Places” was the theme
for this year’s Challenge, and participants were tasked to think critically
about the interplay of nature and culture within our urban milieu. Regenites
Wong Kei Xuan (S3-Gratitude), H Ng Peng Swee, Nora Saung, and Soo Hui Xuan
(S3-Honour) produced a short film for the Challenge’s Creative Component,
which sought to capture and reflect on the various landmarks dotting our
neighbourhood, Choa Chu Kang. They also had to complete a rigorous individual
closed-book assessment as part of the competition, and the team worked
together on a quiz for the group component.</p>
<p>Although the team did not progress to the finals, participating in the
Challenge was nonetheless a valuable learning experience for all. As Peng
Swee reflects, ‘Participating in the Geography Challenge has indeed broadened
my horizons. I’ve learnt that Geography goes beyond the study of facts,
figures and nature. In fact, Geography touches upon everything around us—from
urban spaces to tourism.’</p>

<h2><strong>Geography Field Trip at Gardens by the Bay</strong></h2>
<p>On 11 March, the Secondary 4 Express Geography students embarked on an
exciting journey beyond the confines of their classroom. In a bid to foster
a more immersive and relevant learning experience, the Humanities department
organised a field trip to Gardens by the Bay for a Geographical fieldwork.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this outing was to allow students to delve into
real-world environments and explore geographical phenomena firsthand. Split
into groups, students were tasked with interviewing visitors and tourists
to gather data that would help them validate various hypotheses. This hands-on
approach required the application of geographical fieldwork techniques
and skills, offering students a practical understanding of the subject.</p>
<p>Beyond academic pursuits, the field trip also provided an invaluable opportunity
for students to gain insight into the world of tourism. By engaging with
visitors and observing the dynamics of a popular tourist attraction, students
were able to develop a deeper appreciation for the intersection of geography
and tourism in everyday life.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a highly rewarding day for our graduating classes, offering
them a glimpse into the practical applications of their studies and fostering
a greater understanding of the world around them.</p>

<h2><strong>Secondary Two Literature Enrichment Programme – The LKY Musical</strong></h2>
<p>Literature came alive for our Secondary Two students who attended Singapore
Repertory Theatre’s production of The LKY Musical on 21 September 2022.
Now in its second run, the blockbuster show tells the story of Singapore’s
first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and charts his journey from student
to politician fighting for Singapore’s independence.</p>
<p>There were gasps of awe and delight as our students entered the Sands
Theatre and took in the elaborate sets. They were riveted by the cast’s
impeccable acting and singing and marveled at how music by the live orchestra
helped add to the play’s emotional impact. For many of our students, it
was their first time watching a play, and the experience certainly imbued
them with a greater appreciation of the drama texts that they have been
studying in the Literature classroom. Likewise, it was fascinating to hear
the stories of individuals significant to our nation’s history and to encounter
them beyond the pages of our History textbooks.</p>
<p>The trip to the theatre was undoubtedly a rich learning experience for
our Regenites, and we look forward to the next!</p>

<h2><strong>Geography Fieldwork</strong></h2>
<p>Fieldwork is an essential component of Geography as it provides a real-world
opportunity for students to explore the subject in relation to the real
world and encourages our students to be active participants of their own
learning.</p>
<p>On 14th&nbsp;March 2022, 23 Secondary 3 Pure Geography students conducted
a Geographical Investigation along Pasir Ris Beach to test out the hypotheses
they had previously crafted in class. Students collected geographical data
on the physical and human processes taking place along Singapore’s ever-changing
coastline. They also had a chance to walk along the mangrove boardwalk
to sketch and study the various adaptations of mangrove trees.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts and reflections of some of our Secondary 3 Geographers
after the fieldwork:</p>
<p>“At Pasir Ris beach, we had the first-hand experience of carrying out
various fieldwork techniques which we learnt in the classroom. We also
took a close look at the adaptation features of mangroves such as aerial
roots. Through this fieldwork, I have a better understanding of the coastal
processes taking place along Singapore’s shoreline. Overall, I had a really
enjoyable and meaningful time there with my friends and teachers.” – Hidayah
(3-Determination)</p>
<p>“Through the process of collecting geographical data along Pasir Ris beach,
it allowed me to discover and challenge theories which were previously
taught and discussed in class. This fieldwork has also allowed me to extend
my learning beyond the classroom. We were fortunate enough to see the rich
biodiversity found at Pasir Ris, such as monitor lizards, mudskippers,
tree climbing crabs and even a snake! I had a wonderful time doing this
fieldwork and hope that we have the opportunity to carry out similar fieldtrips
in the future!” – Shinnel (3-Integrity)</p>

<h2><strong>Cool Factor Learning Journey to Gardens by the Bay &amp; Tourism Fieldwork</strong></h2>
<p>A learning journey to Gardens by the Bay was organized for the Pure Geography
students to study environmental sustainable technologies and innovative
solutions used in the running and maintenance of the attractions. The students
learnt about the purpose behind the creation of the 11 Super Trees in the
park and how they help in water conservation and managing carbon emission
in running the park facilities and attractions.</p>
<p>After the hour long guided experience in the Cloud Forest, students executed
their planned tourism fieldwork by conducting interviews with visitors
to the attractions around Gardens by the Bay.&nbsp;This is the primary
data collection process of the fieldwork skills which is an essential component
of their O levels. Students were also treated to a complementary visit
to Flower Dome. This visit coincided with the Sakura Tokidoki event in
the dome.</p>
<p>Ashlee Lim (Secondary Four) shared that she has learnt about interesting
facts about the plants such as the Bromeliads and the Pitcher plants. Prince
June (Secondary Four) reflected that not only is the Super Tree a tourist
attraction in Singapore, it also collects rainwater to cool down the 2
domes, which is environmentally sustainable!</p>
<p>It was a great opportunity for the students to experience tourism concepts
beyond the classroom setting.</p>

<h2><strong>Learning Journey to National Museum</strong></h2>
<p>Our Secondary Two students had a wonderful time at the National Museum
of Singapore on 11 January. Founded in 1887, Singapore’s oldest museum
seeks to showcase stories of Singapore and the world, through its exciting
line-up of exhibitions and programmes. Its galleries include the Singapore
History Gallery on level 1, and four Life in Singapore Galleries on level
2.</p>
<p>Students who went for the trip had a riveting time immersing themselves
in in a period when Singapore was under the Japanese Occupation up till
the Road to Independence. For Saiful Alam Shah and Toh Wen Bin of Class
2-Pride, it was mesmerising for them to know more about how people lived
back then. They were also inspired to know more about our nation’s post-independence
years.</p>
<p>After a hiatus from Learning Journeys due to the pandemic, we are glad
that our students had a chance to expand their horizons beyond the four
classroom walls and step into our enchanting past. We also hope that this
intriguing experience will make all of us more proud to be a Singaporean
or part of the Singapore community!</p>

<h2><strong>Bringing Geography to Life!</strong></h2>
<p>To find out more about the dynamic nature of coastal environments, 15
geography students and 4 teachers conducted a Geographical Investigation
using the Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) at Pasir Ris Park on 17 March 2021.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Humanities%20Department/S3GeoInvestig2021-1.jpg">
</div>
<p>Students carried out a series of fieldwork investigations, such as sketching
the coastal environment, measuring the beach profile and determining the
direction of longshore drift in order to test various hypotheses on the
relationships between the human and the physical coastal environment. One
experiment conducted was investigating how long an orange took to travel
from one point to another when carried by the sea waves. Back in the classroom,
students analysed the data collected to rethink and challenge theories
that they had learnt.</p>
