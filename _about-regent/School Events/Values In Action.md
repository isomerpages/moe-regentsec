<h2><strong>Empowering Secondary 3 Students through Values-in-Action Projects</strong></h2>
<p>At Regent Secondary School, we believe in nurturing our students through
meaningful community engagement. Our Secondary 3 students recently embarked
on their Student Initiated Values-in-Action (VIA) Project, a pivotal component
of our educational ethos. This initiative empowers students to proactively
engage with the community while taking ownership of their learning journey.</p>
<p>Throughout the first semester, our students collaborated closely with
a variety of esteemed organisations. These partnerships spanned from those
supporting children and the elderly to institutions dedicated to the intellectually
disabled. Each student meticulously planned and executed activities tailored
to meet the unique needs and interests of their chosen organizations' beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Guided by principles of teamwork, organisation, flexibility, and problem-solving,
our students ensured the seamless implementation of their initiatives.
Beyond the logistics, they formed genuine connections with the beneficiaries,
learning invaluable lessons in service, responsibility, empathy, and kindness
towards vulnerable members of our society.</p>
<p>We are immensely grateful to the following organisations for their collaboration
and support in our VIA Initiative 2024:</p>
<p>1. Allkin Active Aging Centre (Rivervale &amp; Paris Ris)
<br>2. North-West CDC
<br>3. Methodist Welfare Services (Yew Tee)
<br>4. MINDS
<br>5. Sheng Hong Student Care Centre
<br>6. SUN-DAC (CCK)</p>
<p>Through these experiences, we aim to instill a spirit of volunteerism
in our students, inspiring them to continue making positive contributions
to our community. Regent Secondary School remains committed to fostering
compassionate leaders who understand the importance of service and community
engagement. Together, we strive to create a brighter future for all.</p>
