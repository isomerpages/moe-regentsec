<h2><strong>Secondary 4 Values in Action (VIA) Project Showcase</strong></h2>
<p>Each year, our secondary four students embark on a class-wide Values-in-Action
(VIA) advocacy project, where they prepare and deliver presentations to
their secondary three juniors.</p>
<p>Through these presentations, Regenites have the opportunity to share with
their juniors the meaningful VIA projects they carried out as a class previously,
as well as advocate for the beneficiaries they had worked with. Best practices
are also shared with the aim of inspiring their peers and juniors to embark
on their own awareness campaigns and advocacy work.</p>
<p>On presentation day this year, our secondary four students had fun sharing
their work and insights with the secondary three cohort through videos,
skits, and exciting quizzes. They also shared with their juniors useful
tips on project management and brainstormed ideas for better engaging potential
beneficiaries to meet their needs.</p>
<p>We hope that the pearls of wisdom shared by our graduating cohort will
inspire and equip our Regenites to be transformational leaders and changemakers
within our community!</p>

<h2><strong>Sec 4 VIA 2023</strong></h2>
<p>In 2023, 4-Pride and 4-Respect reached out to the elderly at Ang Mo Kio
Family Service Centre as part of their Secondary Three Values-in-Action
(VIA) projects. This year, their juniors, the current Secondary Three students
will be about to embark on the same journey themselves!</p>
<p>Therefore, the 4-Pride and 4-Respect students took this opportunity to
share their experiences with their juniors. 4-Pride shared about their
project planning process, as well as the challenges that the class faced.
On the other hand, 4-Respect created a poster and conducted role-plays
to showcase tips on interacting with the elderly.</p>
<p>Ian Yap Hao Yi, VIA Representative of 4-Respect said, “It was a daunting
task to oversee the presentation. I felt satisfied that the role-plays
entertained the Secondary Three students. I am glad that they were able
to learn more about the ways to better interact with the elderly through
our presentation. Overall, I feel that I have grown as a leader.”</p>

<p>Similarly, Nurlydia Binte Mohammad, VIA Representative of 4-Pride commented
that organising the VIA project was a daunting but fulfilling task. “Even
though the process was not easy, I have learnt to work with others. I have
also picked up presentation skills along the way. I am proud that my class
received positive feedback from the audience.”</p>

<p>As Seth Godin once said, "Transformational leaders don't start by denying
the world around them. Instead, they describe a future they'd like to create."
We believe this sharing will guide the Secondary Three students well as
they embark on their journey to improve the lives of others. Blaze forth
Regenites!</p>

<h2><strong>Sec 1 to Sec 3 VIA 2023</strong></h2>
<h4>Bringing about positivity and change… Regent VIA Week</h4>
<p>As Term 2 draws to a close, our students were given the opportunity to
contribute back to the community during Regent VIA week. Throughout the
week, our Sec 1 to 3 students planned and initiated a series of community
outreach activities to benefit the school, neighbourhood and community.
This was a culmination of many weeks of planning during CCE and the Cohort
Leadership Programme that aimed to nurture our students into transformational
leaders and agents of change.</p>
<p>The Sec 1 students carried out an Environment Champions Exhibition with
each class adopting an environmental cause, ranging from Car-Lite Lifestyle
to Upcycling, to bring about awareness of how we can be more environmentally
conscientious in our daily actions.</p>
<p>The Sec 2 students organised a community carnival for the seniors in the
Limbang Community for an afternoon of fun and learning. During the carnival,
seniors were able to learn about growing an edible garden, watch student-led
song and dance performances and interact with our students in various games
and even sing-along via a session of Karaoke!</p>
<p>Finally, the Sec 3 students carried out their class-initiated VIA projects
with beneficiaries, ranging from seniors to the migrant workers. Each class-based
VIA project was carefully chosen by the student themselves based on their
interests and passion and we were glad that the students and beneficiaries
really enjoyed themselves.</p>

<p>Youth. Passion. Advocates. Causes.</p>
<p>These are apt terms when it comes to our Sec 4 students. For their Values-in-Action
Projects, our Sec 4 students adopt causes that they are passionate about
and served as advocates to educate their peers and their juniors during
Class Contact Time for Term 2 Week 5 and Week 6.</p>

<p>Their enthusiasm and charisma permeated through the morning air as they
delivered their presentations using a variety of means – videos, Kahoot
quizzes and real-life skits to increase awareness on issues such as peer
pressure, online gaming to the appreciation of our school’s cleaners.</p>

<p>Many of the audience were charmed and won over by our Sec 4 advocates
in a manner that even James Dean would approve.</p>
