## **S4 VIA Project**

Youth. Passion. Advocates. Causes.

These are apt terms when it comes to our Sec 4 students. For their Values-in-Action Projects, our Sec 4 students adopt causes that they are passionate about and served as advocates to educate their peers and their juniors during Class Contact Time for Term 2 Week 5 and Week 6.

Their enthusiasm and charisma permeated through the morning air as they delivered their presentations using a variety of means – videos, Kahoot quizzes and real-life skits to increase awareness on issues such as peer pressure, online gaming to the appreciation of our school’s cleaners.

Many of the audience were charmed and won over by our Sec 4 advocates in a manner that even James Dean would approve.
