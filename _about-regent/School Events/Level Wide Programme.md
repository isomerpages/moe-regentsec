<p>During the March holidays, a group of enthusiastic Regenites embarked
on a deep dive into the world of eye care at Ngee Ann Polytechnic‚Äôs Applied
Learning Module (ApLM) on Eyesight Matters. This interactive session provided
them with a firsthand look at vision science, the importance of eye health,
and the role of optometry in daily life.</p>
<p>From learning about common eye conditions to experimenting with optical
equipment, Regenites explored the science behind clear vision through engaging
hands-on activities. They examined various types of eyewear and discovered
how lifestyle habits impact eyesight. A standout moment of the workshop
was the personalised hands-on session, where students measured each other's
pupil distances, cut tinted lenses, and even assembled their own sunglasses‚Äîbringing
home a one-of-a-kind, practical souvenir.</p>

<p>For Ashlyn Chuan Jia Ning (4 Honour), the experience was particularly
eye-opening: ‚ÄúThe ApLM for optometry was interesting indeed. What piqued
my interest was the lens-cutting session. That session made me realise
I am more interested in polytechnic courses compared to Junior Colleges
(JC) as the hands-on activity involved was something new to me."</p>
<p>Beyond optometry, the module showcased the interdisciplinary nature of
science. Nur Rasyiqah Binte Masri (4 Respect) reflected on this newfound
perspective: ‚ÄúWhat I liked about the ApLM is that it taught me more than
just optometry. I learned how both Biology and Physics are applied in some
fields, rather than being dedicated to just one. Not only that, but I also
appreciated how the teachers were willing to teach with patience, understanding
that we are not at that level of education yet."</p>
<p>This experience served as a powerful reminder that just as education broadens
the mind, good vision opens doors to endless possibilities. As Helen Keller
once said, <em>‚ÄúThe only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.‚Äù With newfound knowledge and awareness, these future changemakers walked away with a clearer vision‚Äînot just for their eyes, but for their future!"</em>

<h2><strong>Applied Learning Module (ApLM) at Ngee Ann Poly: Social Innovations for Future Change</strong></h2>
<p>How can we tackle real-world social issues and make a difference in our
communities? That was the challenge posed to our Secondary 4 Social Studies
students during the Applied Learning Module (ApLM) programme at Ngee Ann
Polytechnic, held from 19 to 21 March 2025. Over three immersive days,
students explored pressing societal challenges, learned about social innovation
strategies, and applied their knowledge to create practical solutions for
a better future.</p>
<p>The programme encouraged students to step beyond their textbooks and think
critically about global and local issues. Working in teams, they identified
social problems, proposed solutions, and eventually presented their findings
to a panel of lecturers. But learning didn‚Äôt stop in the classroom‚Äîthe
experience was enriched with two eye-opening learning journeys.</p>
<p>The first stop was the Science Centre, where students explored exhibits
highlighting key social issues, sharpening their analytical skills as they
connected real-world problems with theoretical concepts. Next, they visited
the Enabling Village, an inclusive community space that champions empowerment
for individuals with diverse abilities. The visit served as a powerful
reminder that everyone has a role to play in building an inclusive society.</p>

<p>For many participants, ApLM was more than just an academic exercise‚Äîit
was a personal journey of discovery and inspiration.</p>
<p>David Gabriel (4-Empathy) reflected, "<em>The 3-day programme gave me the opportunity to learn about global issues and made me realise how fortunate we are in Singapore. The group discussions were fun and educational, as we explored creative solutions to pressing social challenges. This experience also helped me think more deeply about my post-secondary options.</em>"</p>
<p>Echoing similar sentiments, Walton Tan (4-Determination) shared, "<em>The ApLM programme was really engaging as we got to hear trainers discuss real-world issues. It also tied in with what we learn in Social Studies about globalisation, but with deeper insights beyond the textbook. The learning journeys made me more aware of the different social strata in our society, and I now feel inspired to do my part in helping the less fortunate.</em>"</p>
<p>Beyond deepening their understanding of social issues, students also gained
newfound motivation for their post-secondary aspirations. By engaging with
real-world challenges and collaborating on meaningful solutions, ApLM empowered
them to become future changemakers‚Äîdriven, compassionate, and ready to
make a difference.</p>
