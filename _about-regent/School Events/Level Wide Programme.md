### **Secondary 3 NA Elective Modules Programme**

Our 3N(A) Regenites visited ITE College Central from 29th March to 1st April  to take part in several Elective Modules (EM) offered by the institution. This learning journey is part of MOE’s effort to broaden the learning experiences of N(A) students and provide opportunities for them to take part in applied learning. Some of the modules extended to them were Engineering, Business &amp; Services, Design &amp; Media and Electronics &amp; Info-comm Technology. It was an enriching and meaningful experience for our 3N students as they received the opportunity to discover the possible career pathways in these industries.

#### **Video Production Module**

One of the EMs that the students engaged in was Video Production. On their first day of doing so, the students learnt how to make use of simple video editing software to create a simple video of a topic of their choice. Even though this was the first time most of the students were exposed to the Mac OS, our students managed to quickly grasp the basics and created a few quirky short videos!

Students also tried their hands at piecing a 30 seconds advertisement video, using stock footage provided by the college. Through the hands on learning, they were able to experience the joy and frustrations behind the creation of a successful commercial video.

#### **Design and Build Your Own Glider Module**

In this module, students learn about the science of aerodynamics. In the second half of the module, they received hands-on experiences in designing, building and testing their own air gliders.

It was a thrilling sight to see the glow on the students' faces as they watched with excitement and pride their gliders flying high at the end of the day!

#### **Theatre Module**

Lights, camera, action!

Secondary 3 NA students and the students from “Dramatiques” started the day on a high note with their active participation in a team activity!

After an hour of fun to get their creative juices flowing, the students worked hard on their script for an act to be presented on the final day. It was a fun challenge for them as they also had to get their lighting plot planned so that the lights and actors’ blocking positions can be carried out smoothly later.

Finally, it was time for script reading, a process where the group came together to run through their scripts in preparation for the actual performance tomorrow! Our students played theatre games, "Fruitseller" and "Samson, Delilah and Lion" to learn the importance of timing, remembering their script and working in teams.  They were taught theatre discipline and learned commands that theatre practitioners would use.  During the improvisation segment, they read given lines, created a scene and expanded it with their own lines to end their stories with a twist.

#### **Personal Finance Module**

Insurance. CPF. Loans. Investment. Stocks. These were some of the key words learnt by the students at this module. Though intimidating initially, it was a fulfilling experience to learn so much from the experts in the Essentials of Personal Finance module.

Through the lectures, they learnt to plan their finances, the advantages and disadvantages to buying life insurance, what is CPF and many more. There was also an active participation by students in group discussions and presentations, where many shared interesting knowledge with fellow peers. The Elective Modules are designed to provide interactive and immersive experiences. We hope that the programme would encourage students to equip themselves with key skills that are relevant in the workplace of tomorrow.
