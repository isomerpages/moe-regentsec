In the spirit of giving and sharing in the month of Syawal, Regent’s Malay Language Unit has embarked on project ‘Bingkisan Aidilfitri’. ‘Bingkisan Aidilfitri’ is a collaboration between the Muslim staff of Regent Secondary School and our graduating students to express our sincere appreciation to our school support staff for their relentless effort in ensuring a safe and conducive environment for all staff and students.

This initiative, collectively funded by Muslim staff of Regent Secondary School, aims to share the joy of Hari Raya with the school’s support staff. Through this project too, the teachers hope to instil a sense of gratitude as well as to cultivate the spirit of giving back to the society among our students. Giving back comes in many forms; monetary donation, volunteering and sharing of gifts with the less fortunate. The spirit of Ramadan does not only encourage believers to fast, but also to celebrate and reflect on our lives as well as to count our blessings and live with the spirit of generosity.

## **Mother Tongue Fortnight 2021**

Regent Secondary School Mother Tongue Fortnight, which took place from 26th April to 29th April 2021, aimed to create an immersive environment to promote the use of Mother Tongue languages beyond classrooms and encourage cultural discovery through an authentic and fun learning experience. In addition to learning and using the language, students were exposed to a wide range of activities.

A wide range of activities, both within and beyond the classrooms, were conducted to enable students to learn and use Malay Language in novel and exciting ways.

Secondary 1 students had the opportunity to learn one form of handicraft, namely Wau Batik Painting and a Virtual Tour Programme of Kampung Glam.

At the end of the second session, they had the chance to perform the new skill they had picked up.  In addition, the Malay students also had the opportunity to learn a form of handicraft in the form of Basket Weaving Workshop.

On top of those activities, the students were also able to experience activity booths during their recess and lunch breaks. The booths showcased different activities for the whole week. The activities ranged from Wau Batik Painting, Traditional Games, Wayang Kulit puppet-making and Roti Jala Making and displaying of Malay Hari Raya Cookies.

Students’ involvement had been very encouraging. They are clear indications of our students’ love to use and learn the Malay language. The following are some of students’ reflections:

“I am very glad to be able to participate in the Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme this year, particularly the ‘Dikir Barat’ session! It brought my classmates from different races together as we co-ordinated our hand movements in unison to sing our own rendition of a classic Hari Raya song. I am proud to be able to expose my classmates to Malay culture and I hope they enjoyed the session as much as I did!” – Muhammad Erryan Bin Mohamad Faizul, Class 3 Empathy

“This year, we had an array of activities for our Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme. There was a booth set up at the canteen that featured Malay traditional Wau painting, traditional games, and a demonstration on making Wayang Kulit puppets as well as making of Roti Jala, which is a Malay delicacy. The highlight of the week was the activity we had on Thursday afternoon when we had the chance to learn the skill of weaving baskets! I also had a chance to learn Silat, the traditional Malay self-defence art. These activities sparked my interest to deepen my knowledge on Malay culture and I look forward to participating in more cultural events in future!’’- Ainin Sofiya Binte Md Kamal, Class 3 Determination

“I had the chance to do Wau painting as well as create my own Wayang Kulit character. It was all worth the effort when I saw the product of my creativity. I also had the chance to make my own herbal insect repellent using spices this week. I am very happy to be able to participate in the activities and hope to learn more in next year during our Mother Tongue Programme!”- Emir Affiq Bin Mohd Azhari, Class 2 Pride

Overall, these activities provided authentic opportunities for all students to use their Mother Tongue Language and experience the Malay culture and heritage. Well done to all the participants of the MT Fortnight!
