<p>At Regent, we envision our students as global citizens deeply rooted to
their cultural identities. Through the Mother Tongue Fortnight programme,
we aim to instill in our Regenites a profound appreciation and respect
for their Mother Tongue languages and culture by setting them on a journey
of exploration of their linguistic heritage.</p>

filled with pride at the enthusiasm and dedication displayed by our students.

where cultural diversity is celebrated and cherished.</p>

<h2><strong>Conversational Chinese Malay Language Programme 2023</strong></h2>
<p>Semester 1 saw our Secondary 1 and 2 students kickstarting their language-learning
journey with the Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) Programme. An MOE-initiative
launched in 2005, CCM provides learners with an elementary understanding
of a third language: Mandarin-speaking students will learn Malay, and vice
versa.</p>
<p>Slated to run till August, our students can, in this 10-week programme,
look forward to learning how to read and speak in the target language through
engaging activities such as role-plays and quizzes. To enhance their leaning
of the language, students will also be introduced to aspects of Chinese
and Malay culture‚Äîtheir customs, food, and festivals!</p>
<p>As they say, ‚ÄúLanguage is a gateway to culture‚Äù. It is our hope that through
these lessons, our students will not only take away with them conversational
skills in Chinese / Malay, but also a deeper appreciation for the diversity
of cultures and racial harmony that we have in Singapore.</p>

</div>
<p>In the spirit of giving and sharing in the month of Syawal, Regent‚Äôs Malay
Language Unit has embarked on project ‚ÄòBingkisan Aidilfitri‚Äô. ‚ÄòBingkisan
Aidilfitri‚Äô is a collaboration between the Muslim staff of Regent Secondary
School and our graduating students to express our sincere appreciation
to our school support staff for their relentless effort in ensuring a safe
and conducive environment for all staff and students.</p>
<p>This initiative, collectively funded by Muslim staff of Regent Secondary
School, aims to share the joy of Hari Raya with the school‚Äôs support staff.
Through this project too, the teachers hope to instil a sense of gratitude
as well as to cultivate the spirit of giving back to the society among
our students. Giving back comes in many forms; monetary donation, volunteering
and sharing of gifts with the less fortunate. The spirit of Ramadan does
not only encourage believers to fast, but also to celebrate and reflect
on our lives as well as to count our blessings and live with the spirit
of generosity.</p>

conducted to enable students to learn and use Malay Language in novel and
exciting ways.</p>

<p>Secondary 3 students, inclusive of the non-Malay students, had an enjoyable

<p>On top of those activities, the students were also able to experience
activity booths during their recess and lunch breaks. The booths showcased
different activities for the whole week. The activities ranged from Wau
Batik Painting, Traditional Games, Wayang Kulit puppet-making and Roti
Jala Making and displaying of Malay Hari Raya Cookies.</p>
<p>Students‚Äô involvement had been very encouraging. They are clear indications
of our students‚Äô love to use and learn the Malay language. The following
are some of students‚Äô reflections:</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am very glad to be able to participate in the Mother Tongue Fortnight
Programme this year, particularly the ‚ÄòDikir Barat‚Äô session! It brought
my classmates from different races together as we co-ordinated our hand
movements in unison to sing our own rendition of a classic Hari Raya song.
I am proud to be able to expose my classmates to Malay culture and I hope
they enjoyed the session as much as I did!‚Äù ‚Äì Muhammad Erryan Bin Mohamad
Faizul, Class 3 Empathy</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis year, we had an array of activities for our Mother Tongue Fortnight
Programme. There was a booth set up at the canteen that featured Malay
traditional Wau painting, traditional games, and a demonstration on making
Wayang Kulit puppets as well as making of Roti Jala, which is a Malay delicacy.
The highlight of the week was the activity we had on Thursday afternoon
when we had the chance to learn the skill of weaving baskets! I also had
a chance to learn Silat, the traditional Malay self-defence art. These
activities sparked my interest to deepen my knowledge on Malay culture
and I look forward to participating in more cultural events in future!‚Äô‚Äô-
Ainin Sofiya Binte Md Kamal, Class 3 Determination</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had the chance to do Wau painting as well as create my own Wayang Kulit
character. It was all worth the effort when I saw the product of my creativity.
I also had the chance to make my own herbal insect repellent using spices
this week. I am very happy to be able to participate in the activities
and hope to learn more in next year during our Mother Tongue Programme!‚Äù-
Emir Affiq Bin Mohd Azhari, Class 2 Pride</p>
<p>Overall, these activities provided authentic opportunities for all students
to use their Mother Tongue Language and experience the Malay culture and
heritage. Well done to all the participants of the MT Fortnight!</p>
