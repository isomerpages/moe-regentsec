<h2><strong>Post-Exam Activities: Indian Cultural workshop</strong></h2>
<p>At Regent Secondary School, our Secondary 1 students recently participated
in an enriching workshop centered on Indian cultural practices. This immersive
three-day program featured activities such as Rangoli design, pottery,
and thoranam weaving, offering students hands-on opportunities to appreciate
and learn about the rich history and traditions of the Indian community.
Initiatives like this play a vital role in fostering cultural understanding
and appreciation in Singapore’s diverse society.</p>
<p>The Rangoli session introduced students to the intricate art of creating
colorful patterns using materials such as colored powders, rice, and flower
petals. Traditionally made during Indian festivals like Deepavali, Rangoli
symbolizes welcome and good fortune. Through this activity, students developed
skills in design and color coordination while gaining a deeper understanding
of the symbolic significance behind this beautiful art form.</p>

<p>The pottery activity provided students with insight into an ancient Indian
craft that has been cherished through generations. Under guidance, students
shaped clay into pots similar to those traditionally used in Indian households
for cooking and storage. This hands-on experience taught them patience,
creativity, and an appreciation for the cultural importance of sustainable
practices.</p>

<p>In the thoranam weaving workshop, students created decorative garlands,
typically hung at the entrances of homes during special occasions to symbolize
prosperity and well-being. Traditionally made using mango leaves, thoranam
embodies joy, celebration, and respect for tradition. Using ribbons, students
crafted their own thoranam and discovered the significance of these decorations
in Indian culture.</p>
<p>This workshop offered our students valuable knowledge about Indian cultural
practices and an appreciation for the rich diversity within Singapore.
Experiences like these contribute to the holistic development of our students,
nurturing respect and empathy for different cultural backgrounds and strengthening
the bonds within our vibrant community.</p>

<h2><strong>Pesta Budaya 2024: A Gateway to Tradition</strong></h2>
<p>At the heart of Woodlands Civic Centre, Regent Secondary School students
proudly hosted a captivating booth during Pesta Budaya 2024—a celebration
of Malay traditional games. Dressed in traditional Malay attire, they warmly
welcomed visitors, inviting them to experience a slice of heritage. Their
booth, adorned with nostalgic motifs, attracted curious onlookers. Here,
‘gasing’ were spun, ‘congkak seeds’ were counted, and ‘capteh’ floated
in the air, defying gravity. But this wasn’t just play; it was an educational
journey into the origins, meanings, and life lessons embedded in each game.</p>
<p>Senior Minister of State Mr. Zaqy Mohamed visited the booth, his presence
bridging generations. The students, both nervous and proud, explained their
mission: to rekindle interest, honour their roots, and pass on their heritage.
Through these games, they sowed seeds of appreciation and continuity, showing
that these weren’t just relics of the past—they were vessels of wisdom,
resilience, and joy.</p>
<p>As the event drew to a close, the students reflected on their success.
They had met their goals: raising awareness, showcasing the significance
of these games, and planting hope for the future. They envisioned children
laughing, elders reminiscing and the sounds of marbles echoing through
time. In that sunlit corner, the past came alive alongside the present.
And the students carried forward a legacy—one that whispered, “Play on,
for our culture lives within you.”</p>
