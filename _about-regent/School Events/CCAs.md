### **NPCC & RCY Dragon Boating SEP**

Clear skies greeted our National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and Red Cross Youth (RCY) cadets on 12 August 2022 as they arrived at Lower Seletar Water Sports Centre for their Sports Enrichment Programme activity: dragon boating!

Cadets from the two Uniformed Groups mingled freely with one another and were intrepid in trying their hand at a new sport together. There were plenty of laughs and they enjoyed a splashing good time with friends old and new. Although some were initially hesitant about the rigours of the activity, many eventually took away with them new skills and a greater appreciation of the importance of teamwork in this watersport.

All in all, it was a truly fitting way to end the week; and we look forward to more delightful inter-UG activities to come!

### **Girls Brigade Commemoration Day 2022**

On 15 July 2022, cadets from the Girls’ Brigade (GB) came together to commemorate GB Day with a parade and presentation at Assembly. ‘To rise above, venture forward, and journey onward’ is the theme of GB Day this year; and our girls certainly lived that out in their work with Lions Befrienders on GB Friendship Day, where they set out to fulfil the wishes of twenty elderly persons in the community.

They applied the skills acquired in their Design and Technology lessons to fix shoe racks for the elderly, and then ventured out into the neighbourhood to personally deliver these to the elderly residents and to interact with them. Although it was initially awkward meeting the residents for the first time, it proved to be a meaningful time of bonding for our girls and a lesson in empathy and servant leadership.

May our Girls’ Brigade cadets continue to grow in love for another and to serve others in a greater way!

### **NSG Ceremony 2022**

On 14 April 2022, our school held a National School Games (NSG) Ceremony for our student athletes to celebrate the return of the NSG in full swing. It will be the first time our students will be able to participate in the NSG again, after it was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic the past two years.

Amidst deafening applause, representatives from our Sports and Games CCAs, namely Badminton, Basketball, Football, Netball and Taekwondo, walked down the centre aisle of the school hall with much pride and enthusiasm.

The highlight of the ceremony focused on the motto, “Character in Sporting Excellence”, where our student athletes recited the Athletes’ oath as a reminder to uphold the virtues of sportsmanship in the tournament. Mr Michael Kwok, Senior Teacher/PE, recited the Coaches’ Oath on behalf of all teachers and coaches who endeavour to develop each athlete to his/her fullest potential. Mr Isaac Jiang, PE teacher, represented all officials involved in NSG 2022 in reciting the Officials’ Oath, pledging to uphold its professionalism.

The ceremony culminated with the presentation of the school jerseys by our Principal, Mr Leong, to the captains of each team. The jersey presentation symbolises our school values of Passion, Respect, Integrity, Determination and Empathy (P.R.I.D.E.), which our student athletes will embody as they don the school colours for each game.

We would like to wish our Sports and Games CCAs the very best as they compete in their remaining games. May they “Blaze Forth To Glory”!

### **Sec 4 UG Passing-Out Parade**

Lightning Risk Alerts and COVID-19 Safe Management Measures did not deter our Uniformed Group leaders from taking centre stage at our annual Passing-Out Parade (POP), held on 13 April. Incidentally, the parade was the school’s first live event this year, which made it extra special.

Although initial plans for the parade were quite abruptly changed due to the wet weather, our cadets stood proud and tall in the hall, and the Change of Command was executed smoothly with our Principal, Mr Leong, and the Regent community bearing witness to this momentous occasion. For NPCC’s Staff Sergeant Farahin, the parade was a ‘memorable once-in-a-lifetime moment’ to cherish, having played an instrumental role as its Regimental Sergeant Major. Parade Commander and Head of UG Sergeant Jarell Leong of the Boys’ Brigade shared that he was proud to see his CCA members come together as one to adapt quickly to the sudden changes, and a strong sense of camaraderie amongst the UGs could be felt throughout the event.

Reflecting on this significant milestone, Red Cross Youth Chairperson Warrant Officer Chua Kong Chuan commented, ‘It was surreal handing the drill cane over to my successor, but I was also comforted to know that the unit would be in good hands’.

Indeed, we would like to thank our graduating batch of UG leaders and cadets for their selfless contributions to the CCA and school community. Taking the helm of our three key UGs are: Corporal Xavier Oh (BB), Corporal Chaw Shao Xuan (NPCC), and Corporal Edmund Teo (RCY). Congratulations!

### **BB & GB Outdoor Activities**

School’s out… Adventure’s in!

On 26 February 2022, our Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade companies participated in their first adventure outing of the year — kayaking and standup paddleboarding at the BB/GB campsite!

It was truly a day of fun in the sun for many of our boys and girls. For Tan Hao Yu (1-Pride), he enjoyed the feeling of being in the water as he had not been to the pool for a long time since the start of the pandemic. Shaynel Peh (1-Gratitude) even made some new friends during the kayaking activity! Though Kayden Lim (2-Gratitude) was initially apprehensive about being able to paddleboard successfully, he managed to maneuver the paddleboard confidently over the course of the activity, and had a whale of a time.

There’s never a dull moment at CCA for our BB and GB cadets, and they can certainly look forward to many more exciting adventures in the weeks to come!

### **Secondary One CCA Orientation – CCA Experience 2022**

On 7 January 2022, our newest members to the Regent family—our Secondary One students—had their first introduction to the vibrant CCA programme at Regent Secondary School.

Led by our student leaders, the Secondary Ones participated in a wide range of exciting CCA activities specially organized by their energetic seniors. Our students will, over the next two weeks, have a taste of all 17 CCA programmes that Regent has to offer—Sports & Games, Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts, and Clubs & Societies. Kudos to our CCA student leaders, and we warmly welcome our Secondary Ones to the CCA Family at Regent! May the next three sessions of CCA Experience be meaningful for all!

### **Regent Taekwondo Team participated in the National School Games**

This year, our Regent Taekwondo Team participated in the National School Games (‘B’ Division).

The National Taekwondo Championships is the culmination of our Taekwondo members’ four-year journey with the CCA and a key platform for our members to put their skills to the test. We are proud to announce that our Taekwondo team has managed to clinch a total of 4 medals at the 2021 ‘B’ Division Taekwondo Poomsae individual and team events!

Additionally, two of our Secondary Four students, Darren Tan Bo Cong and Norfasarie Binte Noor Haizat, were awarded the Best Sportsmanship Award, one of the highest honours at the Games.

Our Taekwondo team’s wonderful results are indeed a testament to the respect, dedication, and resilience that they have demonstrated in their rigorous training sessions. They have persevered against all odds, despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic.

Reflecting on the experience, Chloe Phua, who was awarded a Gold medal at the Poomsae Individual (Girls) event, shared that she has learnt the importance of determination and having a strong mentality in order to overcome any difficulties in life. This was also echoed by our Best Sportsmanship awardees, Darren and Fasarie, who said that the experience of participating in this competition was certainly valuable, and winning the award has taught them that it is important to always show respect to their opponents when competing.

A huge thank you to the teachers and coaches, and well done, Regenites!

### **Boys’ Brigade Founders Day 2021**

Boys’ Brigade (BB) Founder’s Award ceremony was held on Friday, 23 July 2021.

The Founder’s Award is the highest and most honourable award a Boy can attain in the Seniors Programme. Achieving it indicates that the person exemplifies the traits and ideals of the movement, such as perseverance and commitment.

WO Zavier Wong and WO Hugo Teo of 91st Singapore Company (Regent Secondary School) are awarded the Founder’s Award. Both Boys have shown outstanding leadership abilities and character befitting that of a model BB Boy.

WO Zavier Wong shared that he has learnt how to be a more confident leader who is able to rally his team to achieve common goals.

WO Hugo Teo reflected that through his experiences in BB, he has grown to be a more determined student who is able to lead his team to overcome challenges.

We are proud of both of them and look forward to their active contribution in the community!

### **Regent Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2021**

The Singapore Youth Festival – SYF Arts Presentation (Secondary School) is a biannual event organised to celebrate the vitality of our youth and their diverse arts talents.

The SYF Arts Presentation aims to:

*   develop cultural awareness and appreciation through aesthetics education
*   serve as a platform for the development of character through the arts
*   encourage mass participation in arts (CCAs) in schools

For all Performing Arts students in Regent Secondary School, SYF is one of the main highlights of their time in CCA. The students from the English Drama, Modern Dance, Concert Band and Show Choir dedicated many weeks and months of hard work to showcase their passion for the Arts. Learning to use body language to tell meaningful stories, sing in harmony, move in synchronized actions and fine-tune articulations were definitely not easy but our students were resilient and determined to achieve excellence. The preparation for this highly anticipated event was truly tiring, but the process was well worth it. The students grew to become stronger performers, developed a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Arts and forged stronger relationships with their peers, teachers, seniors and instructors.

Let us take a look at how Regent Secondary School’s Performing Arts students prepared themselves to participate at this year’s SYF. Do continue to support our Performing Arts members and we wish them all the best. Let’s Blaze Forth to Glory!

**SYF Arts Presentation Dates:**

*   Concert Band (1st and 5th April 2021)
*   English Drama (14th April 2021)
*   Modern Dance (15th April 2021)
