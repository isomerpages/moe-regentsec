<p>The days leading up to RMUN were both challenging and exciting. Our dedicated
delegates worked tirelessly to craft position papers that accurately reflected
the views of their assigned countries, while also refining their opening
speeches to ensure confident and impactful delivery. During the assembly,
they actively participated in council sessions and engaged in dynamic debates,
demonstrating adaptability and quick thinking when faced with unexpected
scenarios. Their ability to respond to new developments and seamlessly
integrate them into ongoing discussions highlighted their resilience and
strategic thinking. By the end of RMUN, our delegates had successfully
crafted a draft resolution and garnered support from other schools, showcasing
their persuasive skills and collaborative spirit.</p>

<p>Beyond these immediate achievements, the RMUN experience was truly transformative
for our students. It allowed them to forge meaningful connections with
peers from other schools, step out of their comfort zones, and enhance
their public speaking skills. Reflecting on his experience, Bing Yang shared,
“RMUN has taught me how to thrive in high-pressure environments. I’ve learned
what it means to be an effective speaker. Participating in the various
debates and council sessions has deepened my understanding of global issues
and helped me forge new friendships.” Matthew echoed these sentiments,
adding, “RMUN has profoundly shaped my understanding of our world. The
experience has helped me become a more confident public speaker and to
engage deeply in global issues, stepping out of my comfort zone and embracing
public speaking.”</p>
<p>We congratulate our delegates for their exemplary representation and impactful
contributions. Their success at RMUN is a testament to their dedication
and passion for environmental advocacy. We look forward to supporting more
students in participating in such enriching experiences in the future!</p>

<h2><strong>Let's Race</strong></h2>
<p>In our efforts to galvanise Regenites towards becoming socially responsible
stewards of the environment, our school embarked on a 5-week journey to
empower students to “Reduce our Air pollution and Carbon Emissions” (RACE).
This is especially relevant as climate change continues to be a pervasive
issue that requires our attention.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School Events/Environment/LetsRace2024_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>Our journey towards achieving a more sustainable lifestyle started with
our dedicated Environment Champions passionately raising awareness among
their fellow peers on the detrimental effects that climate change has on
the planet and how human actions are escalating its effects. Our Champions
advocated for a greener lifestyle through everyday actions that Regenites
can take at home and in school to reduce their carbon footprint, which
included simple actions like walking.</p>
<p>At the same time, Regenites were introduced to “The Stridy Challenge”,
which involves the use of the “STRIDY” mobile application to record the
number of litter items collected and walking distance covered. Through
the usage of the STRIDY application, Regenites were not only able to catalogue
the different types of litter collected <em>(e.g. cigarette buds, cans, plastic bottles, tissue paper)</em>,
but also acquired insights into the collective positive impact that their
classmates, schoolmates, and even Singaporeans are leaving on the environment,
one piece of litter at a time.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>To create a healthy level of competition within the respective levels,
classes were encouraged to catalogue their litter items and walking distance
over a span of five weeks to clinch 2 coveted titles. “The Litter Heroes”
was awarded to the class that recorded the highest number of litter items
picked, and “The Regent Walkers” was awarded to the class that recorded
the longest walking distance covered. Congratulations to all the classes
on their wonderful efforts to make a difference to our environment.</p>

<h2><strong>Let's Go GREEN</strong></h2>
<p>2024 is the inaugural year for Regent’s Let’s be Green advocates! The
event, where Green (in short for Grow Responsible Ecology and Environment),
is a week when students come together tocreate awareness on the environment
and promote actions to live sustainability.</p>
<p>On 13 and 14 May, the Environmental Science club and Class Environment
Champions set up game booths at the canteen where students learnt more
about the 3Rs and food sustainability through games and posters. Students
could challenge themselves to the card game “Recycle Right” or the Green
version of the classic snake and ladder board game “Karang Guni Man” or
even try out the ping-pong ball game where they answered questions on the
3Rs and carbon footprint to earn prizes!</p>
<p>During CCT period on 14 May, a digital show on “Climate Change and Us”
by The Voice wasshown, which shared the effects of climate change and recommendations
on what students can do to reduce food wastage, play their part to protect
biodiversity and reduce climate change. The highlight of Let’s be GREEN
took place during the Secondary 1 Cohort’s Values in Action programme (VIA)
on 15 May. The theme of the VIA was ‘Environment’ and the Clubs and Societies
prepared booths showcasing artefacts they had created on the theme.</p>
<p>Robotics’ Sustainability through Innovation showed off a self-watering
sensor for plants. Students from the school’s InfoComm shared photos on
nature that were entitled ‘Capturing Change: Photography for a Sustainable
Future’. Lastly, Design and Innovation presented their upcycle ventures
including upcycled tote bags and stationery holders which were creatively
re-designed. Regent Show Choir did their part too and spent their time
composing a song entitled “The World is Changing” to encourage students
to open their eyes to the world around them and play their part in sustainability
and the Regent Pop Band composed a song entitled “Save the Earth” to encourage
everyone to play our part to save our only home. On top of that, various
subjects such as English, Mathematics, Science and Geography also came
together to put up an interdisciplinary booth to showcase the students’
artefacts on the theme of “Water”.&nbsp; All in all, the collective effort
by Regenites made the event a successful and memorable one.</p>

<h2><strong>Commemoration of World Water Day</strong></h2>
<p>A Journey Towards Conservation: Reflecting on World Water Day 2024:</p>
<p>On 22 March, our school community united to observe World Water Day, a
global initiative dedicated to underscoring the significance of freshwater
and advocating for its sustainable management. This year, our commemoration
was marked by a thought-provoking morning Assembly session led by Mdm Zainab
Banu, who shared invaluable insights on the importance of water conservation.</p>
<p>But our commitment did not end there. On 26 March, our Environment Champions
took charge, guiding their peers through engaging sessions aimed at understanding
water footprints and exploring practical strategies to minimize them. These
sessions, thoughtfully crafted by students from the Environmental Science
Club, underscored our collective dedication to raising awareness about
environmental issues.</p>
<p>As these sessions concluded, students were encouraged to reflect on their
learning and make personal pledges to conserve water. Using the digital
platform Padlet, each student shared their commitment to reducing water
wastage both at home and at school.</p>
<p>As we reflect on the events of World Water Day 2024, let us carry forward
the knowledge, awareness, and dedication instilled in us. Let us remain
steadfast in upholding our pledges and continue our journey towards a future
where clean and accessible water is a reality for all. Together, as stewards
of the environment, we can truly make a difference!</p>

<h2><strong>Earth Day 2023</strong></h2>
<p>Earth Day was commemorated globally on the 22nd of April. To kickstart
the commemoration in Regent, students from the Environmental Science Club
shared with their peers during Morning Assembly on the need to protect
our Earth. Aligning to this year’s theme on Food Sustainability, they also
shared on how we can build our food resilience.</p>
<p>Back in class, the Environment Champions shared a video on ways to practise
the 3Rs at home. They further shared ways to reduce food wastage such as
ordering only what you need and they encouraged good recycling habits among
their peers by setting up a class recycling corner in the class. Chew Cai
Ling from 2-Empathy shared that she has learnt not to be picky when choosing
fruits or vegetables as “ugly” fruit does not mean that the quality of
the food is poor.</p>
<p>Students also visited the booths set up at the canteen and attempted the
SLS lessons on Food Sustainability to find out more on how they can take
actions to protect the Earth.</p>

<h2><strong>World Water Day 2023</strong></h2>
<p>World Water Day is held annually on 22 March, a day designated by the
United Nations (UN) to commemorate the importance of water as a resource.
In Singapore, we mark World Water Day with a month-long celebration to
rally the community to appreciate and conserve water resources for sustainability.</p>
<p>At Regent Secondary School, we marked World Water Day with a slew of activities.
Staff came dressed in blue to show their solidarity for the national movement
for water conservation. Talks were also conducted by Regenites to raise
awareness about the depletion of water resources worldwide and the urgent
need to conserve it for the sake of all mankind. The Environmental Science
club anchored a segment at Morning Assembly to share tips on how to conserve
water both at home and in school. Our Environment Champions chipped in
too with an interactive Kahoot quiz to engage their classmates on the topic.</p>
<p>Here’s what one of our Secondary Two students had to say about the commemorative
activities in school: ‘I found the World Water Day commemoration in school
meaningful. We do face water shortages around the world today, and it is
important to take action now to help conserve water. My peers and I have
pledged to do our part through our water pledges on display at the Canteen!’
(H Ng Peng Swee, 2-Pride)</p>

<h2><strong>World Environment Day</strong></h2>
<p>World Environment Day falls on 5th June 2022. To commemorate this momentous
day and do our part for Mother Earth, Regent held an Environment Week starting
from 23 to 27 May!</p>
<h4><strong>Student Collaboration</strong></h4>
<p>Several CCAs came onboard to contribute with the common goal of advocating
for changes we can make by tweaking our lifestyle. Students from the Show
Choir came up with their very own music jiggle to spread environmental
messages while our Drama Club collaborated with InfoComm Club and produced
2 videos on reducing carbon footprint in and outside of school. The Robotics
Club made use of Blockie to design a structure to house potted plants and
coded a device to monitor the humidity of the plants. Our Student Council
is partnering with Northwest CDC to conduct an online zoom workshop for
Yew Tee residents on the fundamentals of 5Rs and to share tips on how to
upcycle old clothes into tote bags.</p>
<h4><strong>Showcase Boards</strong></h4>
<p>To reach out to our student population, our Environmental Sciences Club
put display boards showcasing ways to recycle right and share information
on the nature of biodiversity in school and Singapore at large. Through
this, students learnt the names of the common birds sighted in school.
Together with the Class Environment Champions, students also had the chance
to try out hands-on activities like upcycling empty plastic bottles into
zipper containers and folding paper box origami which can be used to place
their items or waste.</p>
<p>All of us can play a part to protect our Earth by making changes to our
lifestyle habits. We hope every Regenite would take on the role as Mother
Earth’s ambassadors and spread the message of environmental conservation
messages to people around us!</p>

<h2><strong>Environmental Science Photography Workshop</strong></h2>
<p>In partnership with Canon Imaging Academy and PUB, our Environmental Science
CCA attended a Photography Workshop on 27 April 2022.</p>
<p>This workshop was curated specially for our school and provided participants
with an introduction to the science and mechanics of how cameras are designed
and function. Students were shown how to adjust camera settings effectively
in order to optimise visual results and how to best achieve the correct
balance between lens, light, subject and composition.</p>
<p>Apart from offering the space and time to learn new skills in photography,
the workshop also allowed our Environmental Science students a valuable
opportunity to take a closer look at their physical surroundings.</p>
<p>Seeing our world through the lens of a camera, we often look more critically,
evaluating the relationship between the natural and man-made environment
in which we live, assessing the natural symmetry as well as discordant
notes in our surroundings. In planning their images, students began to
understand the influence of our surroundings on how we perceive the world.</p>
