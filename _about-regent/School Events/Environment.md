## **World Environment Day**

World Environment Day falls on 5th June 2022. To commemorate this momentous day and do our part for Mother Earth, Regent held an Environment Week starting from 23 to 27 May!

#### **Student Collaboration**

Several CCAs came onboard to contribute with the common goal of advocating for changes we can make by tweaking our lifestyle. Students from the Show Choir came up with their very own music jiggle to spread environmental messages while our Drama Club collaborated with InfoComm Club and produced 2 videos on reducing carbon footprint in and outside of school. The Robotics Club made use of Blockie to design a structure to house potted plants and coded a device to monitor the humidity of the plants. Our Student Council is partnering with Northwest CDC to conduct an online zoom workshop for Yew Tee residents on the fundamentals of 5Rs and to share tips on how to upcycle old clothes into tote bags.

#### **Showcase Boards**

To reach out to our student population, our Environmental Sciences Club put display boards showcasing ways to recycle right and share information on the nature of biodiversity in school and Singapore at large. Through this, students learnt the names of the common birds sighted in school. Together with the Class Environment Champions, students also had the chance to try out hands-on activities like upcycling empty plastic bottles into zipper containers and folding paper box origami which can be used to place their items or waste.  
  
All of us can play a part to protect our Earth by making changes to our lifestyle habits. We hope every Regenite would take on the role as Mother Earth’s ambassadors and spread the message of environmental conservation messages to people around us!

## **Environmental Science Photography Workshop**

In partnership with Canon Imaging Academy and PUB, our Environmental Science CCA attended a Photography Workshop on 27 April 2022.

This workshop was curated specially for our school and provided participants with an introduction to the science and mechanics of how cameras are designed and function. Students were shown how to adjust camera settings effectively in order to optimise visual results and how to best achieve the correct balance between lens, light, subject and composition.

Apart from offering the space and time to learn new skills in photography, the workshop also allowed our Environmental Science students a valuable opportunity to take a closer look at their physical surroundings.

Seeing our world through the lens of a camera, we often look more critically, evaluating the relationship between the natural and man-made environment in which we live, assessing the natural symmetry as well as discordant notes in our surroundings. In planning their images, students began to understand the influence of our surroundings on how we perceive the world.

## **Earth Day**

Have you ever wondered where the waste that we throw goes once it leaves our homes? How knowledgeable are you in sustainable fashion, compost and carbon food print?

From the food we consume to the everyday items used by us, every little item that we discard creates an impact on the Earth. Regent Secondary School commemorated Earth Day on 22 April 2022 and our Environmental Science Club raised awareness among their peers on how we can protect our planet and ensure sustainability. An information board was placed in the canteen to share about the little actions that we can partake in to help conserve our environment. QR codes were prepared for peers to embark on online quizzes to test their environmental literacy, knowledge on sustainable fashion and calculate their plastic consumption levels.

Seeking to contribute a small part, students from the Environmental Sciences and InfoComm CCA groups joined forces to clean up Stagmont Park. Through this experience, they realized how each person could make a difference in ensuring the cleanliness of the shared environment. A presentation was also shared during our morning assembly session to educate fellow Regenites about this important day.

Let’s all do our part and invest in our planet to keep it sustainable for future generations. Happy Earth Day!

## **World Water Day 2023**

World Water Day is held annually on 22 March, a day designated by the United Nations (UN) to commemorate the importance of water as a resource. In Singapore, we mark World Water Day with a month-long celebration to rally the community to appreciate and conserve water resources for sustainability.

At Regent Secondary School, we marked World Water Day with a slew of activities. Staff came dressed in blue to show their solidarity for the national movement for water conservation. Talks were also conducted by Regenites to raise awareness about the depletion of water resources worldwide and the urgent need to conserve it for the sake of all mankind. The Environmental Science club anchored a segment at Morning Assembly to share tips on how to conserve water both at home and in school. Our Environment Champions chipped in too with an interactive Kahoot quiz to engage their classmates on the topic.

Here’s what one of our Secondary Two students had to say about the commemorative activities in school: ‘I found the World Water Day commemoration in school meaningful. We do face water shortages around the world today, and it is important to take action now to help conserve water. My peers and I have pledged to do our part through our water pledges on display at the Canteen!’ (Ng Peng Swee, 2-Pride)
