<h4>World Water Day 2025: Making Every Drop Count through Glacier Preservation and Water Conservation</h4>
<p>On 27 March, Regent Secondary commemorated World Water Day with a vibrant
line-up of activities aimed at raising awareness about the importance of
water conservation. This year’s global theme—Glacier Preservation—shone
a spotlight on the urgent need to protect the world's glaciers, which are
vital to sustaining freshwater supplies across the globe.</p>
<p>The event kicked off with engaging presentations by our Environment Champions,
who shared eye-opening facts about glaciers, their significance, and the
challenges we face in ensuring global water security. Complementing these
efforts were insightful materials curated by Environmental Science students,
who highlighted Singapore’s commitment to reducing per capita water usage
to 130 litres per day by 2030. Their messages underscored the role each
individual plays in this collective mission.</p>

<p>To make the learning experience both interactive and enjoyable, students
took part in online quizzes on Kahoot! and Blooket. These platforms allowed
students to test their knowledge on glacier preservation and responsible
water usage in a fun and dynamic way. Meanwhile, the Environmental Science
students added a buzz to the canteen with their engaging booth games, offering
students a hands-on approach to learning about sustainable water practices.</p>

<p>The celebration culminated in a meaningful pledge activity, where students
penned their personal water-saving commitments on the Applied Learning
Programme (ALP) Wall. This powerful display of student voices serves as
a lasting reminder of our shared responsibility to safeguard water resources.</p>
<p>World Water Day 2025 at Regent was not only educational but also deeply
impactful, reminding us that small, conscious actions—when multiplied—can
lead to significant change. Together, let’s keep up the momentum and make
every drop count!</p>
