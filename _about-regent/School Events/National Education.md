## **NRIC Presentation Ceremony 2022**

20 October 2022 was a special day for our Secondary Three students, who received their NRICs from our Principal and their Form Teachers.

To kickstart the presentation ceremony, a lesson on citizenship was conducted and our students learnt more about the significance of the NRIC and the rights and privileges they enjoy as a Singapore citizen. Of course, with these privileges come great responsibilities that one should uphold as a citizen of the country. Our students then participated in an in-class discussion where they thought about ways they could actively contribute to our nation’s progress. Students pledged to do their part through small actions like picking up litter to keep our country clean, serving National Service, and shared their aspirations for making Singapore a better place for all to live in. The ceremony rounded off with a photo-taking session where our students proudly displayed their NRICs, now imbued with new meaning. ‘The NRIC is important in helping to identify Singaporeans. It is a significant document that recognises one as a citizen or Permanent Resident of the country. I am glad that I can finally identify myself as a true Singaporean, not just with my passport, but also with this card. It gives me a sense of belonging to the country, and I am very thankful for that,’ shared Siti Nurul Aireen Binte Rozali (3-Respect).

For Tay Jin Yi (3-Empathy), the momentous occasion has helped shape her understanding about what it means to have a sense of identity and belonging to this place we call Home. ‘I am forever grateful to our founding fathers and pioneers for all that they have done for our nation. Knowing this has made me more motivated to contribute back to society as part of Singapore’s future generation of leaders.’

Indeed, John F. Kennedy once said, ‘Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.’ It is our hope that our Regenites grow to become responsible men and women who take great pride in defending and shaping our nation through civic action and public service.

## **National Day Celebration 2022**

Each time we sing the lines in the chorus of our National Anthem, “Majulah Singapura”, we are filled with a strong sense of patriotism and hope for Singapore. The theme for this year’s National Day, “Stronger Together, Majulah” aptly brought out the spirit of the nation as we commemorated the event on 8 August 2022. “Stronger Together” reminds Singaporeans that unity in our diversity is what makes us stronger, whereas “majulah”, which means “onward”, encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our independence 57 years ago.

The day started off majestically at the parade square as the school gathered for the Observance Ceremony. Our sharp-looking Uniformed Group cadets were already in formation, representing the fortitude of Singapore. The Concert Band alleviated our pride during the singing of national anthem as we sang along to their live performance. As the students recited the “Recollections” and chanted refrains like “We pledge to keep our nation free, with justice and equality”, we solidified the pledge that the future is in our hands, and we should not take our independence for granted. Our strong emotions continued to soar as Show Choir led us in the singing of “My Nation, My Home.”

During the national day lesson, students had a chance to reflect on their experience of living through the pandemic and make a commitment on how they could contribute to a future they envision for Singapore by submitting their digital pledge. The future of Singapore is also dependent on our international relationships and Singapore is one of the founding countries of ASEAN. Since 8 August happened to be ASEAN Day, NE Ambassadors led their classes in a Kahoot activity to remind students of the role ASEAN plays for the nation.

In the last segment, the school gathered once again in the hall for the concert item. We were greatly entertained with a live drama programme entitled, “Pieces of You, Pieces of Me” by Interaction Arts and Drama Network. Through the character, Sam, students were reminded of the critical role they play in preserving our nation’s heritage and defending the nation.

To see our dreams come alive, the National Day edition of Regent Rave gave us the chance to hear our students share their well-wishes for Singapore. We were inspired to be stronger together and take actions for our beloved country. Hence, it was momentous for the school to rejoice the culmination of “Together Regent Care,” in which every member of Regent family contributed goody bags for our partners in the community as well the support staff in our school.

The day ended in a high note as we were once again serenaded by Regent Pop Band who performed some of our favourite National Day melodies. Show Choir students once again led the school in the singing of community songs as we expressed our love and joy for Singapore.

All in all, Regent Secondary School would like to wish Singapore a Happy 57th birthday and we are proud and exhilarated to celebrate this significant day with the nation!

## **Racial Harmony Day 2022**

Regent came together to commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21 July, and it was a day where our students reflected on and celebrated Singapore as a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures.

‘Multicultural Mosaic’ is the theme for 2022, and it aptly reflects how each community, while having the space to express its own identity, intertwines with others to create the unique cultural diversity that characterises Singapore life. To bring this theme alive, we had an inter-class competition where our students drew beautiful mosaics that showcased the richness of our culture with food, costumes, festivals, and traditional entertainment galore!

The hall too was a sea of colours as our students gathered for the Racial Harmony Day Concert. To mark the occasion, many donned traditional costumes such as the baju kurung, cheongsam, and sari, and they took pride in explaining the significance of their attire to their peers. The school was abuzz with excitement as our lively student emcees took the stage and shared interesting tidbits about the various festivals celebrated in Singapore. English Drama also put up a meaningful performance about how our forefathers had to navigate changes and learn to work with different groups to make Singapore a prosperous place.

For student Lim Xin Tong (1-Empathy), the highlight of the concert was seeing Regent Pop Band perform a medley of songs in Malay and Mandarin. The performance served as a reminder that we can enjoy and appreciate music and entertainment from many different cultures in Singapore.

Finally, our students continued discussing the issue of race during their weekly CCE lessons, where they reflected on their personal experiences. Newspaper articles were also used as a springboard to discuss contemporary events pertaining to the topic.

Celebrating Racial Harmony Day 2022 was a poignant reminder that all of us play a critical role in maintaining social cohesion in Singapore.

## **e-Internationalisation**

Regent Secondary School had its first inaugural Internationalisation Programme with students from Botany Downs Secondary College, Auckland, New Zealand at the end of Semester 1 this year.

The Internationalisation Programme aims to equip Regenites with a global perspective. With globalisation, students will need to possess multi-cultural literacy and the use of technology which is becoming increasingly important.&nbsp;Bearing the concept that “The World is my Classroom”, this international exposure provides opportunities for students to engage in real-world application of knowledge, skills and values which will be beneficial academically and holistically.

After the opening addresses by our Principal, Mr Leong Kok Kee and Head of Social Sciences of Botany Downs Secondary School College, Ms Karen Douglas, the sharing commenced and students had the chance to interact with each other and share about their country, their school life and environmental sustainability.

#### **From Regent Secondary School**

One of the students, Bryan Wong (3-Integrity) said, "It was good to meet them ‘live’ on-screen and to share with them about our hawker culture and interesting places in Singapore. We also introduced them to Regent Secondary School. I hope that we will be able to interact further with Botany Secondary School students in future and forge new friendships with them.”

Environmental Sciences CCA leaders, Joeie Neo (3G) and Grier Quah (3-Empathy), shared, "I liked the sharing on environmental sustainability in Botany Downs Secondary Collège and hope to implement some of their ideas in our school. When I knew that I was selected to participate in the e-internalization program, I had a mixed feelings of excitement and being nervous. Throughout this e-internalization, I gained a better understanding of what New Zealand schools are doing to protect the environment and observed how their lifestyles are very different from ours.

Kar Yan (3 Empathy) noted, “The students were very friendly. Initially, I was scared and nervous, but I overcame this when I realized that they were students of the same age. They were open to sharing of their learning experiences and I hope to meet them one day.”

#### **From Botany Downs Secondary College**

It was fun to see how they spend their mornings in Singapore. I liked their uniforms because they were very classy and looked excellent. It was fascinating learning about Singapore. Singapore looks like a great place to live and learn. I now want to move there, they made it so appealing. - Maddy

I really enjoyed listening to the entire presentation and meeting people from a different part of the world. I learnt a lot about Singapore and how they spend their mornings quite differently from ours. It gave me an opportunity to compare how our life is in New Zealand to theirs in Singapore. I particularly liked the uniform and the presentation about the different types of foods you can get in street stalls and restaurants. I was quite surprised but impressed with the ban on chewing gum and how people abided to the rule. Overall, I think this was a really great opportunity to meet new people from around the world and compare how different our lives are. - Nyesa

I really liked learning all of the new information about Singapore and their way of life. It was nice hearing about the culture and the food along with the tourist attractions as well. Their school life was the most intriguing to hear about since it was so starkly different from ours in New Zealand. They have so many eco and environment programs and competitions in school. Hearing about the mix of cultures and food was also quite nice since New Zealand is also a mix of cultures and religions. Looking at the presentation slides about food made me quite hungry since the pictures made the food looked so delicious. Overall, it was a very entertaining session where everyone learned something and enjoyed themselves. - Raunaq

In conclusion, as it was a first for us, we were very pleased to hear positive comments from both schools. Though we were on a tight schedule, it was a good start to allow our students to connect with students from another side of the world. It was heartening to see the students expressing interests in having another ZOOM meeting with their new friends, exchanging emails and Instagram accounts to keep in touch and maintain this new friendship.

## **International Friendship Day 2022**

Our Regenites commemorated International Friendship Day on 8 April, and a myriad of activities was organized throughout the week for students to understand the importance of good relations between friends and countries.

At the start of the week, our Principal set the context for Regenites to understand how the conflict in Ukraine could affect Singapore and our sovereignty. Students continued to delve deeper into the topic during CCE lessons by discussing how the war had impacted the people of Ukraine as well as how the international community has responded to the conflict. This deepened our understanding of Singapore’s realities as a small state and the importance of safeguarding our national interests. Students also took part in an exciting inter-class competition, where they designed posters to encapsulate their key takeaways from International Friendship Day.

In addition, students also had the chance to listen to how strong friendships have been forged between Regenites of different nationalities. Our international student, Kim Huiyeon (2-Gratitude) shared about her experience growing up in Korea and how she has adapted to life in Singapore. Her Singaporean classmate, Lee Xin Yan Richelle, shared how she and Huiyeon have strengthened their friendship through common interests.

Our NE Ambassadors also led their classmates to facilitate an engaging activity to learn more about the significance of international friendships. Designed with the principles of Differentiated Instruction, students moved around three Learning Stations set up in the classrooms to access various interactive and rich texts. Students watched interesting videos, read insightful articles from the special IN Edition, and took part in Kahoot quizzes.

Overall, our students had a blast learning about International Friendship Day whilst promoting the spirit of friendship and collaboration. All of us have an active role in fostering people-to-people ties and celebrate the region's diversity and vibrancy!

## **Total Defence Day 2022**

Total Defence is the cornerstone of Singapore’s deterrent strategy, and is crucial to the continued security, survival, and success of the country.

This year, we commemorated Total Defence Day with a slew of activities throughout the week, beginning with a parade by our Uniformed Groups on Tuesday, 15 Feb. It was heartening to see our Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade, National Police Cadet Corps, and Red Cross Youth cadets come together as one for this momentous occasion.

Our weekly CCE lessons also continued to reinforce the need for us to play our part to protect ourselves against hybrid threats. In keeping with this year’s theme, ‘Together We Keep Singapore Strong’, our students created artefacts to pledge the small ways they could help put Total Defence into action in their daily lives. They also joined our Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors at an interactive booth in the canteen where they learnt more about digital defence and even participated in a quiz to win wonderful prizes!

On 17 February, our series of commemorative events concluded with a special programme helmed by the Uniformed Groups. Our enthusiastic UG cadets stepped into every class to promote awareness of and participation in the 6 pillars of Total Defence. Students learnt new skills such as Basic First Aid and familiarised themselves with the Public Warning System as well as the game, ‘Guardians of the City’.

Overall, we had a memorable TDD which enhanced our four key citizenship dispositions: a sense of belonging, a sense of reality, a sense of hope, and the will to act.

Together, we keep Singapore strong!
