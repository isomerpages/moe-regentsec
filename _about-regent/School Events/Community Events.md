<h2><strong>Voice of Youth 2023</strong></h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/VoiceofYouth2023-1.png"></div><p>What are Singaporean youths concerned about nowadays?</p><p>On 28 August, together with students from Kranji Secondary and Unity Secondary, our Student Leaders attended the Voices Of Youth, a post-National Day Rally (NDR) Dialogue with the Marsiling Yew-Tee GRC Grassroot Advisors, including DPM Mr Lawrence Wong and Mayor Mr Alex Yam at Kranji Secondary School.</p><p>Together with the Kranji Secondary Student Leaders, our Sec 3 student leaders also co-facilitated the small group discussions during the dialogue. It was a day of deep learning and fruitful engagement as the student leaders develop a better understanding of the issues emerging from the NDR such as the Majulah Package and the new housing classifications (Standard, Plus and Prime) Our student leaders also had the opportunity to provide suggestions and seek clarifications from the Grassroot Advisors on issues they are concerned about and would like to advocate. It was definitely an insightful occasion and our student leaders certainly look forward to more opportunities to interact and collaborate with our counterparts from our neighbouring schools.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/VoiceofYouth2023-2.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/VoiceofYouth2023-3.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/VoiceofYouth2023-4.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/VoiceofYouth2023-5.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/VoiceofYouth2023-6.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/VoiceofYouth2023-7.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/VoiceofYouth2023-8.png"></div><hr><h2><strong>Limbang National Day Dinner 2023</strong></h2><p>What better way to celebrate National Day than with the community?</p><p>This year, our CCA groups came together to do just that, beginning with a wonderful performance by Regent Concert Band at Limbang’s National Day Dinner on 8 August. As guests dined on a sumptuous spread of local delights, strains of Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” filled the air, followed by a soulful rendition of the popular National Day song, “Home”.</p><p>Our Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade, National Police Cadet Corps, and Red Cross Youth also put up a fine display at the Limbang National Day Observance Ceremony on 9 August. Together with their peers from Unity Secondary School, they paid tribute to the contributions of all Singaporeans in defending our nation through a parade segment. At the Majulah Walk and Run thereafter, our NPCC cadets led the crowd in a spirited GetActive Singapore Workout: Dance of the Nation, alongside Limbang and Yew Tee residents and volunteers from Team Nila.</p><p>“To serve our country and community” is the Uniformed Group ethos, and our Regenites’ participation in these community events have indeed strengthened our pride in and commitment to the places where live, study, work, and play. Happy 58th National Day, Singapore, and may we all continue to move together “Onward as One”!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/LimbangNDDinner2023-2.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/LimbangNDDinner2023-3.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/LimbangNDDinner2023-4.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/LimbangNDDinner2023-5.png"></div><hr><h2><strong>Limbang PAssionArts Festival 2022</strong></h2><p>On 23 July 2022, our Environmental Sciences Club and Modern Dance had the opportunity to participate in the Limbang PAssionArts Festival 2022. Environmental Sciences Club set up a Green Booth where our students shared their knowledge on environmental conservation with the community and our dance group showcased their talents through a modern dance performance.</p><p>At the Green Booth, members of the public had the opportunity to participate in simple upcycling tasks, where they can turn their common household waste into something useful. They had a choice between using toilet rolls and making it into a pillow box or a paper dinosaur or using old magazines and turning it into a paper bag. Participants can then decorate their items and further personalise it. It was a meaningful and memorable experience for our students as it was their first time sharing upcycling tips with members of the public in a face-to-face event.</p><p>Jaime Pat (1-Detemination) reflected that at first, she and her peers felt a little hesitant to interact with the public. But with the help of their seniors, they quickly warmed up to the public. It felt amazing to educate people about what they can do with their common household waste instead of just discarding them. Through this meaningful experience at the Limbang PAssionArts festival, Jaime and her friends had become more confident in interacting with the others. If there was ever another chance to participate in an event like this, she would definitely volunteer to take part again!</p><p>Marion Tye (3-Gratitude) also shared that from this event, he has learnt to step out of his comfort zone and communicate confidently with others. It was not easy at first, however, he took a leap of faith and started to be more confident in facilitating others to work on the upcycling tasks.</p><p>Thank you Limbang for this opportunity for our students to contribute to the community!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/CommunityEvents-2A.jpg"></div><hr><h2><strong>Limbang Raya Show 2022</strong></h2><p>On the 21st May 2022, Choa Chu Kang residents attended the Limbang Raya Show, organised by the Limbang Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC), held in our school hall. The event, graced by the Grassroots Adviser, Mr Lawrence Wong, saw guests streaming into the hall donning their best Hari Raya outfits.</p><p>Members of the audience were serenaded by live singing performances by members of the MAEC as well as local talents Sufie Rashid, Rozaimi and our very own Secondary 5 student Sarah Syazlina, who belted out songs such Suasana Hari Raya by Sharifah Aini and Hari Raya by Najwa Latif.</p><p>The event was especially memorable for our Secondary Three students, who in their newly-formed group, Putera Armada, performed their very first dikir barat performance item on stage! Decked in baju Melayu, kain samping (cloth wrapped around the waist) and tanjak (traditional headgear), the students, trained by Regent’s Operations Support Officer, Mr Abdul Rahman, sang and clapped to the beat of the gong and percussion instruments. Despite coming from different classes and having few training sessions, the performance was made possible due our students’ passion for Malay arts and culture.</p><p>On top of that, prizes that were given out to winners of stage games, lucky draws, house decoration contest and best dressed individuals enlivened the atmosphere. The delectable buffet spread and goodie bags that awaited after the performance made it an event not to be missed as we celebrated the joyous occasion. Although the month-long Hari Raya celebration was drawing to a close, the festive spirit among guests was very much still ablaze!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/CommunityEvents-4.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/CommunityEvents-5.jpg"></div><hr><h2><strong>Creation of Outdoor Diorama in Celebration of National Day @ Limbang</strong></h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/CommunityEvents-6%20NDDiorama1.jpg"></div><p>Regent Secondary School is excited to partner with the community to celebrate this year’s National Day. The members of Design and Innovation Club and Environmental Science Club were chosen to create an outdoor diorama to represent the old and new Singapore. The key theme on the juxtaposition of the old and new showcases features such as on transportation where old modes of transport involving sampans, bumboats and rickshaw are juxtaposed against the modern MRT and aeroplanes&nbsp;represented by Changi Airport. Despite the many challenges posed by the pandemic, the students persevered to complete it.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/CommunityEvents-7%20NDDiorama2.jpg"></div><p>Using the skills taught in Design Thinking and Model Making, the students brainstormed for ideas of what would best represent the old Singapore which they were not familiar with. They decided on the dragon playground in old Toa Payoh as it was a favourite place for many children of different races to play together and form strong bonds. Another idea was based on the godowns along Singapore River as this was where our trading past paved the road for Singapore to become one of the freest port in the world and a champion of free trade. The Marina Bay superstructure and the Supertrees are chosen to represent the new Singapore as they give Singaporeans a strong sense of pride in our achievements.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/CommunityEvents-8%20NDDiorama3.jpg"></div><p>The diorama is displayed at Blk 787, CCK North 6 (opposite Yew Tee MRT) void deck from 31 July 2021 to 31 August 2021.

The hard work put in by them mirrors the toils of the pioneer generations which have benefited them today. The beautiful diorama exceeded their own expectations and we hope it would make the community celebration of National Day more enriching.</p><p>Majulah Singapore!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/CommunityEvents-10%20NDDiorama5.jpg"></div><p></p>
