<p>What are Singaporean youths concerned about nowadays?</p>
<p>On 28 August, together with students from Kranji Secondary and Unity Secondary,
our Student Leaders attended the Voices Of Youth, a post-National Day Rally
(NDR) Dialogue with the Marsiling Yew-Tee GRC Grassroot Advisors, including
DPM Mr Lawrence Wong and Mayor Mr Alex Yam at Kranji Secondary School.</p>
<p>Together with the Kranji Secondary Student Leaders, our Sec 3 student
leaders also co-facilitated the small group discussions during the dialogue.
It was a day of deep learning and fruitful engagement as the student leaders
develop a better understanding of the issues emerging from the NDR such
as the Majulah Package and the new housing classifications (Standard, Plus
and Prime) Our student leaders also had the opportunity to provide suggestions
and seek clarifications from the Grassroot Advisors on issues they are
concerned about and would like to advocate. It was definitely an insightful
occasion and our student leaders certainly look forward to more opportunities
to interact and collaborate with our counterparts from our neighbouring
schools.</p>

<h2><strong>Limbang National Day Dinner 2023</strong></h2>
<p>What better way to celebrate National Day than with the community?</p>
<p>This year, our CCA groups came together to do just that, beginning with
a wonderful performance by Regent Concert Band at Limbang’s National Day
Dinner on 8 August. As guests dined on a sumptuous spread of local delights,
strains of Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” filled the air, followed by
a soulful rendition of the popular National Day song, “Home”.</p>
<p>Our Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade, National Police Cadet Corps, and Red
Cross Youth also put up a fine display at the Limbang National Day Observance
Ceremony on 9 August. Together with their peers from Unity Secondary School,
they paid tribute to the contributions of all Singaporeans in defending
our nation through a parade segment. At the Majulah Walk and Run thereafter,
our NPCC cadets led the crowd in a spirited GetActive Singapore Workout:
Dance of the Nation, alongside Limbang and Yew Tee residents and volunteers
from Team Nila.</p>
<p>“To serve our country and community” is the Uniformed Group ethos, and
our Regenites’ participation in these community events have indeed strengthened
our pride in and commitment to the places where live, study, work, and
play. Happy 58th National Day, Singapore, and may we all continue to move
together “Onward as One”!</p>
