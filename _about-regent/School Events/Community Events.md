<p>What are Singaporean youths concerned about nowadays?</p>
<p>On 28 August, together with students from Kranji Secondary and Unity Secondary,
our Student Leaders attended the Voices Of Youth, a post-National Day Rally
(NDR) Dialogue with the Marsiling Yew-Tee GRC Grassroot Advisors, including
DPM Mr Lawrence Wong and Mayor Mr Alex Yam at Kranji Secondary School.</p>
<p>Together with the Kranji Secondary Student Leaders, our Sec 3 student
leaders also co-facilitated the small group discussions during the dialogue.
It was a day of deep learning and fruitful engagement as the student leaders
develop a better understanding of the issues emerging from the NDR such
as the Majulah Package and the new housing classifications (Standard, Plus
and Prime) Our student leaders also had the opportunity to provide suggestions
and seek clarifications from the Grassroot Advisors on issues they are
concerned about and would like to advocate. It was definitely an insightful
occasion and our student leaders certainly look forward to more opportunities
to interact and collaborate with our counterparts from our neighbouring
schools.</p>

<h2><strong>Limbang National Day Dinner 2023</strong></h2>
<p>What better way to celebrate National Day than with the community?</p>
<p>This year, our CCA groups came together to do just that, beginning with
a wonderful performance by Regent Concert Band at Limbang’s National Day
Dinner on 8 August. As guests dined on a sumptuous spread of local delights,
strains of Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” filled the air, followed by
a soulful rendition of the popular National Day song, “Home”.</p>
<p>Our Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade, National Police Cadet Corps, and Red
Cross Youth also put up a fine display at the Limbang National Day Observance
Ceremony on 9 August. Together with their peers from Unity Secondary School,
they paid tribute to the contributions of all Singaporeans in defending
our nation through a parade segment. At the Majulah Walk and Run thereafter,
our NPCC cadets led the crowd in a spirited GetActive Singapore Workout:
Dance of the Nation, alongside Limbang and Yew Tee residents and volunteers
from Team Nila.</p>
<p>“To serve our country and community” is the Uniformed Group ethos, and
our Regenites’ participation in these community events have indeed strengthened
our pride in and commitment to the places where live, study, work, and
play. Happy 58th National Day, Singapore, and may we all continue to move
together “Onward as One”!</p>

<h2><strong>Limbang PAssionArts Festival 2022</strong></h2>
<p>On 23 July 2022, our Environmental Sciences Club and Modern Dance had
the opportunity to participate in the Limbang PAssionArts Festival 2022.
Environmental Sciences Club set up a Green Booth where our students shared
their knowledge on environmental conservation with the community and our
dance group showcased their talents through a modern dance performance.</p>
<p>At the Green Booth, members of the public had the opportunity to participate
in simple upcycling tasks, where they can turn their common household waste
into something useful. They had a choice between using toilet rolls and
making it into a pillow box or a paper dinosaur or using old magazines
and turning it into a paper bag. Participants can then decorate their items
and further personalise it. It was a meaningful and memorable experience
for our students as it was their first time sharing upcycling tips with
members of the public in a face-to-face event.</p>
<p>Jaime Pat (1-Detemination) reflected that at first, she and her peers
felt a little hesitant to interact with the public. But with the help of
their seniors, they quickly warmed up to the public. It felt amazing to
educate people about what they can do with their common household waste
instead of just discarding them. Through this meaningful experience at
the Limbang PAssionArts festival, Jaime and her friends had become more
confident in interacting with the others. If there was ever another chance
to participate in an event like this, she would definitely volunteer to
take part again!</p>
<p>Marion Tye (3-Gratitude) also shared that from this event, he has learnt
to step out of his comfort zone and communicate confidently with others.
It was not easy at first, however, he took a leap of faith and started
to be more confident in facilitating others to work on the upcycling tasks.</p>
<p>Thank you Limbang for this opportunity for our students to contribute
to the community!</p>

<h2><strong>Limbang Raya Show 2022</strong></h2>
<p>On the 21st May 2022, Choa Chu Kang residents attended the Limbang Raya
Show, organised by the Limbang Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC),
held in our school hall. The event, graced by the Grassroots Adviser, Mr
Lawrence Wong, saw guests streaming into the hall donning their best Hari
Raya outfits.</p>
<p>Members of the audience were serenaded by live singing performances by
members of the MAEC as well as local talents Sufie Rashid, Rozaimi and
our very own Secondary 5 student Sarah Syazlina, who belted out songs such
Suasana Hari Raya by Sharifah Aini and Hari Raya by Najwa Latif.</p>
<p>The event was especially memorable for our Secondary Three students, who
in their newly-formed group, Putera Armada, performed their very first
dikir barat performance item on stage! Decked in baju Melayu, kain samping
(cloth wrapped around the waist) and tanjak (traditional headgear), the
students, trained by Regent’s Operations Support Officer, Mr Abdul Rahman,
sang and clapped to the beat of the gong and percussion instruments. Despite
coming from different classes and having few training sessions, the performance
was made possible due our students’ passion for Malay arts and culture.</p>
<p>On top of that, prizes that were given out to winners of stage games,
lucky draws, house decoration contest and best dressed individuals enlivened
the atmosphere. The delectable buffet spread and goodie bags that awaited
after the performance made it an event not to be missed as we celebrated
the joyous occasion. Although the month-long Hari Raya celebration was
drawing to a close, the festive spirit among guests was very much still
ablaze!</p>

<h2><strong>Creation of Outdoor Diorama in Celebration of National Day @ Limbang</strong></h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>Regent Secondary School is excited to partner with the community to celebrate
this year’s National Day. The members of Design and Innovation Club and
Environmental Science Club were chosen to create an outdoor diorama to
represent the old and new Singapore. The key theme on the juxtaposition
of the old and new showcases features such as on transportation where old
modes of transport involving sampans, bumboats and rickshaw are juxtaposed
against the modern MRT and aeroplanes&nbsp;represented by Changi Airport.
Despite the many challenges posed by the pandemic, the students persevered
to complete it.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/CommunityEvents-7%20NDDiorama2.jpg">
</div>
<p>Using the skills taught in Design Thinking and Model Making, the students
brainstormed for ideas of what would best represent the old Singapore which
they were not familiar with. They decided on the dragon playground in old
Toa Payoh as it was a favourite place for many children of different races
to play together and form strong bonds. Another idea was based on the godowns
along Singapore River as this was where our trading past paved the road
for Singapore to become one of the freest port in the world and a champion
of free trade. The Marina Bay superstructure and the Supertrees are chosen
to represent the new Singapore as they give Singaporeans a strong sense
of pride in our achievements.</p>

<p>The diorama is displayed at Blk 787, CCK North 6 (opposite Yew Tee MRT)
void deck from 31 July 2021 to 31 August 2021. Do drop by if you would
like to take a look! Alternatively, you can also view the diorama from

<p>This project has helped to give the students a better appreciation of
the country. The hard work put in by them mirrors the toils of the pioneer
generations which have benefited them today. The beautiful diorama exceeded
their own expectations and we hope it would make the community celebration
of National Day more enriching.</p>
<p>Majulah Singapore!</p>
