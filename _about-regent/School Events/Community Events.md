## **Limbang PAssionArts Festival 2022**

On 23 July 2022, our Environmental Sciences Club and Modern Dance had the opportunity to participate in the Limbang PAssionArts Festival 2022. Environmental Sciences Club set up a Green Booth where our students shared their knowledge on environmental conservation with the community and our dance group showcased their talents through a modern dance performance.

At the Green Booth, members of the public had the opportunity to participate in simple upcycling tasks, where they can turn their common household waste into something useful. They had a choice between using toilet rolls and making it into a pillow box or a paper dinosaur or using old magazines and turning it into a paper bag. Participants can then decorate their items and further personalise it. It was a meaningful and memorable experience for our students as it was their first time sharing upcycling tips with members of the public in a face-to-face event.

Jaime Pat (1-Detemination) reflected that at first, she and her peers felt a little hesitant to interact with the public. But with the help of their seniors, they quickly warmed up to the public. It felt amazing to educate people about what they can do with their common household waste instead of just discarding them. Through this meaningful experience at the Limbang PAssionArts festival, Jaime and her friends had become more confident in interacting with the others. If there was ever another chance to participate in an event like this, she would definitely volunteer to take part again!

Marion Tye (3-Gratitude) also shared that from this event, he has learnt to step out of his comfort zone and communicate confidently with others. It was not easy at first, however, he took a leap of faith and started to be more confident in facilitating others to work on the upcycling tasks.

Thank you Limbang for this opportunity for our students to contribute to the community!

## **Limbang Raya Show**

On the 21st May 2022, Choa Chu Kang residents attended the Limbang Raya Show, organised by the Limbang Malay Activity Executive Committee (MAEC), held in our school hall. The event, graced by the Grassroots Adviser, Mr Lawrence Wong, saw guests streaming into the hall donning their best Hari Raya outfits.

Members of the audience were serenaded by live singing performances by members of the MAEC as well as local talents Sufie Rashid, Rozaimi and our very own Secondary 5 student Sarah Syazlina, who belted out songs such Suasana Hari Raya by Sharifah Aini and Hari Raya by Najwa Latif.

The event was especially memorable for our Secondary Three students, who in their newly-formed group, Putera Armada, performed their very first dikir barat performance item on stage! Decked in baju Melayu, kain samping (cloth wrapped around the waist) and tanjak (traditional headgear), the students, trained by Regent’s Operations Support Officer, Mr Abdul Rahman, sang and clapped to the beat of the gong and percussion instruments. Despite coming from different classes and having few training sessions, the performance was made possible due our students’ passion for Malay arts and culture.

On top of that, prizes that were given out to winners of stage games, lucky draws, house decoration contest and best dressed individuals enlivened the atmosphere. The delectable buffet spread and goodie bags that awaited after the performance made it an event not to be missed as we celebrated the joyous occasion. Although the month-long Hari Raya celebration was drawing to a close, the festive spirit among guests was very much still ablaze!

## **Hari Raya Celebration 2022**

It has been two years our last Hari Raya mass celebrations in school and this year we are grateful for the chance to come together once more to enjoy the festivities celebrated by our Muslim teachers and peers. Nur ‘iliyin binte Joemarino from 4-Respect shares more about her experience of this special event.

“Hari Raya is a joyous celebration where Muslims all over the world celebrate the end of fasting during the month of Ramadhan. During the celebration in school this year, Muslim students from various levels collaborated with one another and put up a wonderful performance. This year’s performance was fascinating as it was a two in one celebration consisting of pre-recorded video segments as well as live segments. From the video, I learnt more about how Hari Raya Puasa is being celebrated and the different types of cuisines as well as traditional dishes eaten during Hari Raya Puasa. I also finally understand the meaning of Maaf Zahir dan Batin from the explanations given during the quiz segment.

I love the performances because of the different elements of music compiled together back from 1950s to 2000s. It brought back memories for me as we reminisced the traditional Hari Raya songs I grew up listening to. Not only that, I contributed by being part of the ‘Regent Pop Band’ as one of the singers alongside with my band mates. We had covered the song Selamat Hari Raya by Saloma. It was a fruitful experience, singing together and rehearsing our parts to produce the whole Regent Pop Band music video. Even our Malay ‘cikgus’ serenaded us with a song or two!

Personally, I am grateful because it was the first time in two years that all Regenites were able to gather in the school hall once again. It touched my heart as we could finally come together to celebrate Hari Raya as a school once again. I look forward to more celebrations and performances put together for our Regenites in the years to come. Selamat Hari Raya everyone!”

## **Creation of Outdoor Diorama in Celebration of National Day @ Limbang**

![](/images/School%20Events/Community%20Events/CommunityEvents-6%20NDDiorama1.jpg)

Regent Secondary School is excited to partner with the community to celebrate this year’s National Day. The members of Design and Innovation Club and Environmental Science Club were chosen to create an outdoor diorama to represent the old and new Singapore. The key theme on the juxtaposition of the old and new showcases features such as on transportation where old modes of transport involving sampans, bumboats and rickshaw are juxtaposed against the modern MRT and aeroplanes represented by Changi Airport. Despite the many challenges posed by the pandemic, the students persevered to complete it.

Using the skills taught in Design Thinking and Model Making, the students brainstormed for ideas of what would best represent the old Singapore which they were not familiar with. They decided on the dragon playground in old Toa Payoh as it was a favourite place for many children of different races to play together and form strong bonds. Another idea was based on the godowns along Singapore River as this was where our trading past paved the road for Singapore to become one of the freest port in the world and a champion of free trade. The Marina Bay superstructure and the Supertrees are chosen to represent the new Singapore as they give Singaporeans a strong sense of pride in our achievements.

The diorama is displayed at Blk 787, CCK North 6 (opposite Yew Tee MRT) void deck from 31 July 2021 to 31 August 2021. Do drop by if you would like to take a look! Alternatively, you can also view the diorama from the well-produced video by the [Stagmont Park RC](https://www.facebook.com/stagmontparkrc/posts/4349508275111498?__xts__%5b0%5d=68.ARDS5s2T0Aa-4Buq4fD79UpJbg0Cs7oJBQZCwbrSZclz0tTH5JeIsnO1bfz1w-kCUQueH8fZMSBbI2d6cIgLltoGXigU5mqsX7ZidT-it_XDubWx1H3jPeBaXsGNrLK2XUaRY1ZOMsl3QgP4hdZv0HRfCMZ7wj4v-NMOn_eDEvFgfDM4qkzt2W3YjwgrA5DliV2CDEGd1MA-Z0_H1b8GHU9t1CKiqBZZjqq1MVaMpaxqp4Jssi7KkgEeJlknnE2bHdrPeodAhqLgKyN8jEZgsw8fm3OQtkNr).

This project has helped to give the students a better appreciation of the country. The hard work put in by them mirrors the toils of the pioneer generations which have benefited them today. The beautiful diorama exceeded their own expectations and we hope it would make the community celebration of National Day more enriching.

Majulah Singapore!
