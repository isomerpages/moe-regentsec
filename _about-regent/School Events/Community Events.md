<h2><strong>Limbang 10th Anniversary</strong></h2>
<p>To celebrate Limbang’s 10th Anniversary, our Student Leaders dedicated
several weeks to planning, designing, and constructing a wide range of
engaging game booths for the community. Every idea—from canvas painting
to ring toss and even a beanbag knockoutl station—was created completely
from scratch. The councillors also made a conscious effort to use mostly
recycled and repurposed materials, reflecting our commitment to sustainability
and caring for the environment.</p>

<p>On the day of the event, the hard work truly paid off. De La Salle was
filled with laughter, excitement, and the bright smiles of children eagerly
participating in the activities. Their enthusiasm brought each booth to
life and reminded our councillors why service to the community is so meaningful.
Seeing the joy on the participants’ faces made every hour of planning and
preparation worthwhile.</p>
<p>The Student Council and CCA leaders are proud to have contributed to this
milestone celebration, and we look forward to many more opportunities to
serve and connect with our wider community.</p>

<h2><strong>Mid Autumn Festival Celebration</strong></h2>
<p>For this year’s Limbang Mid-Autumn Festival, our Student Councillors once
again poured their creativity and teamwork into designing a series of exciting
and meaningful game booths for the community. Among the favourites was
“Football Mayhem,” played on a mini soccer field handcrafted entirely out
of cardboard. Other booths such as “Lantern on a Lake” and “Maze Escape”
showcased the councillors’ imagination and problem-solving skills, turning
simple materials into interactive and memorable experiences for all.</p>

<p>What made the event truly special was the sight of participants of all
ages—from energetic children to supportive parents and even elderly residents—coming
together to enjoy the games. Watching families laugh, cheer, and bond at
the booths warmed our hearts and reminded us of the strong, vibrant community
spirit that makes Limbang so special.</p>
<p>The Student Councillors and CCA leaders are grateful for the opportunity
to contribute to such a meaningful celebration, and we look forward to
more opportunities to bring joy, connection, and creativity to our community!</p>

<h2><strong>Reduce @ North West</strong></h2>

<p>Our Student Councillors went beyond the school gates to become young advocates
for sustainability as part of the Reduce@North West initiative. Taking
learning into the community, they played an active role in promoting environmentally
responsible habits and encouraging residents to take small but meaningful
steps towards a greener future.</p>
<p>Guided by the goals to engage, educate and encourage, the student councillors
reached out to residents using thoughtfully designed posters to raise awareness
about energy and water conservation and the reduction of food wastage.
They translated sustainability messages into practical, everyday actions,
making the information accessible and relevant to households.</p>

</div>
<p>Through brief yet purposeful interactions, the students encouraged residents
to take action by signing up for the initiative, explaining the benefits
of participation and the collective impact of individual choices. In doing
so, they not only advocated for sustainable living but also helped amplify
the message beyond the school by empowering residents to share these practices
with their families and neighbours.</p>
<p>The experience strengthened the student councillors’ confidence, communication
skills and sense of civic responsibility. More importantly, it reaffirmed
their belief that young people can be effective agents of change.</p>
<p>Through Reduce@North West, the student councillors showed that when awareness
leads to action, and action is amplified through advocacy, positive change
becomes a shared community effort—one that begins with students who care
and choose to lead.</p>
