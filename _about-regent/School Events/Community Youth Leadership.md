## **Student Leaders Investiture 2021**

July 2021. The mid-point. A transition.

Today, as we crossed the mid-point of the year, we take the opportunity to commemorate Youth Day and welcome the appointment of our 11th Student Council and CCA Leaders via a virtual Student Leaders Investiture where students watch the proceedings via Zoom.

As Youth Day recognises the important role that the youth can play in our society, similarly, the investiture recognises the contributions of the outgoing Regent Student Leaders and places the mantle of leadership on our incoming Student Leaders.
