## **Sec 4 & 5 Sports Carnival 2022**

Sec 4 & 5 Sports Carnival (Ultimate Frisbee)

The long anticipated Sec 4 & 5 Sports Carnival finally took place on 20 May! The last time our Secondary 4 & 5 students participated in a Sports Carnival was way back in 2019. Hence, it was clear why many of them were eager to join in the competition. Turning up in their respective class t-shirts, the students came very prepared and dressed well for the occasion! Besides the Ultimate Frisbee competition, various carnival stalls were also set up for all to have fun and joy!

A total of 4 different categories were played in the Frisbee competition – Boys Cup & Plate, and Girls Cup & Plate.

Overall, the competition was intense with fair play much observed. The students applied what they have been learning during the PE lessons and thoroughly enjoyed the competitiveness spirit. The overall class champion went to 4-Empathy. Mervyn Tan from 5-Gratitude and Nur Danisha from 4-Pride won the Sports Boy and Sports Girl awards respectively.

Trophies and medals were also given out to the following Cup and Plate winners by our Principal, Mr Leong.

Boys Cup: 1st (4-Empathy-A), 2nd (4-Respect-A), 3rd (4-Determination-B)  
Boys Plate: 1st (4-Integrity), 2nd (4-Pride-A), 3rd (4-Empathy)  
Girls Cup: 1st (4-Determination), 2nd (5-Gratitude), 3rd (4-Empathy)  
Girls Plate: 1st (4-Empathy), 2nd (4-Pride-B), 3rd (4-Integrity)

A big round of applause to all the winners and everyone for putting in their best! A special shoutout to Regent PE department and all Regent CCA leaders for the wonderfully-organised event!

Looking forward to the Sec 1-3 Sports Carnival in Semester Two!

## **Virtual Run 2022**

_“When your legs get tired, run with your heart.”_

This was the slogan for the highly anticipated Regent Virtual Run 2022. Similar to last year’s edition, our staff and students worked hard to clock their miles for the period of 14 March to 1 April, making good use of their time to run or walk. Exciting awards for the Best Individual and Best Class were up for grabs too!

Through the event, Regenites were able to spend more time with their families and friends, exploring various places in Singapore on foot while clocking their runs. Together, our Regenites did an amazing job during the virtual run, and lived out the slogan by staying the course to clock a whopping total of 10,000 km!

An awards ceremony was conducted on 14 April to recognise the spirited efforts of all. These included the top 10 boys and girls for each level and the top 3 staff (male/female). We are pleased to announce that 1-Integrity, 2-Empathy, 3-Integrity, and 4-Empathy clinched the Best Class awards for their levels! Kudos too to our Taekwondo team, which has been awarded “Best CCA”!

Congratulations to all our award winners, and we hope to see all Regenites continue to stay active and healthy!

![](/images/Sports%20Events/Virtual-Run-Banner-1024x582.png)

In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Regent PE department has organized a virtual run instead of a live event for this year’s Cross Country. Thus, Regent’s Journey Around Singapore Challenge was created!

The challenge for every class is to clock 193km as a class (FYI: The total distance of Singapore’s coastline is 193km!). Students were able to compete with one another through a live leaderboard as well! Students were encouraged to stay active and fit during the pandemic and to run together with their family members as a form of family bonding. 

During the two weeks of the challenge, students are to clock their distance using a distance tracking application on his smart phones. Students will then upload their distance clocked during the run and a screenshot of the route that they ran. The upload was seamless and the instructions were easy to follow! Students can keep track of the total distance that they have clocked via the live leaderboard available on the website.

At the end of the challenge, awards are given out to the top 10 male and female students of each level. Awards for best class per level and top 3 staff members were given as well. Overall, our students and staff are enjoyed their runs and explored new places at the same time. Let’s stay healthy during this period of time and we hope this challenge has motivated everyone to continue to stay active and fit!
