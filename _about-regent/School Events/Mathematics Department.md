Held annually, the Olympiad offers students the opportunity to stretch themselves, as the contest features a range of challenging questions. Prior to the competition, our student participants took part in a series of training workshops, which helped hone their critical thinking, creative problem-solving and mental calculation skills. Here’s what some of our Regenites have to say about the experience:

‘My experience participating in the Math Olympiad and its training sessions has been a fruitful one. It has helped me in various ways. I have learnt how to think out of the box and improve my understanding of questions, and I have picked up some new Mathematical concepts and formulae too. I am happy to have attained the Honourable Mention Award, and I am motivated to do better in the subject.’ (Gregg Loo, 2-Empathy)

‘Participating in the Math Olympiad was an exciting experience for me as I got to work on many different types of questions. It was fun working alongside students from other classes and it’s great to know that there are also many people like me who enjoy Math. I am definitely more curious about Math now because I know there’s loads more to discover!’ (Lyvia Tu, 2-Empathy)

‘I have learnt many new and interesting concepts through the Math Olympiad programme. It has trained me to think more logically. It has also given me a taste of what being in a prestigious programme is like and that has boosted my confidence. Moving forward, I would like to work hard in order to participate in more programmes like this one.’ (Rachel Poon, 2-Gratitude)

## **Financial Literacy Workshop**

On 1st&nbsp;and 2nd&nbsp;June, our secondary 1 and 2 classes&nbsp;took part in a Financial Literacy Workshop organized by Smart Co. This programme was facilitated by students from Temasek Polytechnic and sponsored by HSBC.

Students learnt about financial knowledge through a board game called L Cube which&nbsp;taught them the importance of Life-Long Learning by providing a simulation of real life situations. This enabled students to experience making education, career and financial decisions in a fun and risk-free setting. The experiential learning also took them through the impact of the different economic cycles.

The highlight of the workshop was having HSBC personnel from the region share their experience working in the finance sector. It was a valuable experience for our students to interact with regional leaders and CEOs. Our students thoroughly enjoyed the session!
