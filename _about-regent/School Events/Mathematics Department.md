<h2><strong>Mathematics Olympiad Competition 2023</strong></h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Mathematics%20Department/MathsOlympiad2023-1.png"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Mathematics%20Department/MathsOlympiad2023-2.png"></div><p>Participants’ Feedback on Maths Olympiad Trainings and Competition 2023</p><p>JAIME PAT ROU XUAN from 2-Determination</p><p>As I have learnt from my experience participating in the Mathematical Olympiad, it is not really about solving math equations over and over again. Rather, it has proven to be a great learning opportunity. Thanks to the help of my teacher and peers, I have been able to improve in my math skills. Although many of the questions we encountered were challenging, we overcame the challenges together as a class and learnt various useful methods for solving math problems. I am glad for this opportunity to learn some more advanced math concepts, hone my problem solving skills, and more importantly, to approach challenges with the mindset of pushing myself to do better each time.</p><hr><h2><strong>Mathematics Olympiad 2022</strong></h2><p>Our Secondary Two students recently participated in Singapore Mathematical Olympiad 2022, and we are pleased to announce that Gregg Loo Yi Xuan (2-Empathy) received the Honourable Mention Award! This places Gregg amongst the top performers in the Junior category of the competition.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Mathematics%20Department/MathsDept-1_MathsOlympiad2022-1.jpg"></div><p><em>Photo Of Gregg’s Certificate Presentation</em></p><p></p><p>Held annually, the Olympiad offers students the opportunity to stretch themselves, as the contest features a range of challenging questions. Prior to the competition, our student participants took part in a series of training workshops, which helped hone their critical thinking, creative problem-solving and mental calculation skills. Here’s what some of our Regenites have to say about the experience:</p><p>‘My experience participating in the Math Olympiad and its training sessions has been a fruitful one. It has helped me in various ways. I have learnt how to think out of the box and improve my understanding of questions, and I have picked up some new Mathematical concepts and formulae too. I am happy to have attained the Honourable Mention Award, and I am motivated to do better in the subject.’ (Gregg Loo, 2-Empathy)</p><p>‘Participating in the Math Olympiad was an exciting experience for me as I got to work on many different types of questions. It was fun working alongside students from other classes and it’s great to know that there are also many people like me who enjoy Math. I am definitely more curious about Math now because I know there’s loads more to discover!’ (Lyvia Tu, 2-Empathy)</p><p>‘I have learnt many new and interesting concepts through the Math Olympiad programme. It has trained me to think more logically. It has also given me a taste of what being in a prestigious programme is like and that has boosted my confidence. Moving forward, I would like to work hard in order to participate in more programmes like this one.’ (Rachel Poon, 2-Gratitude)</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Mathematics%20Department/MathsDept-2_MathsOlympiad2022-2.jpg"></div><p><em>Team Photo</em></p><p></p><hr><h2><strong>Financial Literacy Workshop</strong></h2><p>On 1st&nbsp;and 2nd&nbsp;June, our secondary 1 and 2 classes&nbsp;took part in a Financial Literacy Workshop organized by Smart Co. This programme was facilitated by students from Temasek Polytechnic and sponsored by HSBC.</p><p>Students learnt about financial knowledge through a board game called L Cube which&nbsp;taught them the importance of Life-Long Learning by providing a simulation of real life situations. This enabled students to experience making education, career and financial decisions in a fun and risk-free setting. The experiential learning also took them through the impact of the different economic cycles.</p><p>The highlight of the workshop was having HSBC personnel from the region share their experience working in the finance sector. It was a valuable experience for our students to interact with regional leaders and CEOs. Our students thoroughly enjoyed the session!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Mathematics%20Department/MathsDept-4_FinLitWksp1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Mathematics%20Department/MathsDept-5_FinLitWksp2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Mathematics%20Department/MathsDept-6_FinLitWksp3.jpg"></div><p></p>
