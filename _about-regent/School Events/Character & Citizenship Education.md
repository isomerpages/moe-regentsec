<h2><strong>Regent Secondary School Celebrates Safer Internet Day 2025</strong></h2>
<p>Regent Secondary School joined the global celebration of Safer Internet
Day, promoting safe and responsible online use. This year’s theme, "Empowering
a Safe and Resilient Online Community," encouraged students to navigate
the digital world safely while fostering a positive online environment.</p>
<p>On 16 February, Cyber Wellness Ambassadors shared alternatives to screen
time, such as sports, creative arts, and family bonding, inspiring students
to be mindful of their digital habits. They also took part in a Safer Internet
Pledge, committing to responsible online behavior.</p>

<p>The school also partnered with the Singapore Kindness Movement for an
interactive Cyber Kindness Show on 25 February, students learned the THINK
framework—ensuring online posts are True, Helpful, Inspiring, Necessary,
and Kind—and practiced strategies to handle online conflicts and cyber
threats.</p>
<p>Regent Secondary remains committed to fostering a safer, more respectful
digital space. Let’s all play our part in creating a kinder and more resilient
online community!</p>

<h2><strong>Cyber Security Talk and Cyber Fair</strong></h2>
<p>On 23 October, our school hosted an exciting Cyber Awareness Day, filled
with engaging activities aimed at empowering students to make safer and
kinder choices online. The day started with a Zoom Assembly presentation
on cyber security by Mr. Dayang from Touch Community Services. His insights
into the importance of online safety, practical ways to protect personal
information, and steps to safeguard one’s digital well-being set the stage
for the day's activities.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School Events/CCE/CyberFair2024_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>After Assembly, students headed to the Cyber Fair at the canteen. This
interactive fair was designed to educate and inform students about three
critical topics in today’s digital age: cyberbullying, positive online
behaviour, and practicing kindness online. Each station provided unique
learning experiences that were both fun and impactful, giving students
practical tools for navigating the online world responsibly.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the Cyber Fair was the Cyber Safe Pop-Up Vending
Machines, an initiative brought to us by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore.
These interactive vending machines were more than just a fun attraction
– they were an educational experience! Each machine offered students information
on cyber safety tips, along with opportunities to answer questions and
win prizes. Through this interactive experience, students learned valuable
strategies for protecting their digital identities while enjoying the thrill
of winning rewards.</p>
<p>Additionally, game booths manned by our very own Secondary One Cyber Wellness
Ambassadors provided a hands-on learning experience. These dedicated students
guided their peers through a variety of games designed to reinforce lessons
on cyber kindness and the importance of positive online behaviour. Each
game encouraged students to think about real-life scenarios, emphasizing
empathy and respect in their online interactions. The presence of these
young ambassadors not only allowed for peer-to-peer learning but also highlighted
the importance of student leadership in promoting a safe online environment.</p>

<p>Students were enthusiastic participants throughout the day, eagerly engaging
in the activities at the Fair and conversations about online safety. The
chance to win attractive prizes added to the excitement, but more importantly,
each student left with a better understanding of how to be responsible
digital citizens.</p>
<p>Overall, the Cyber Wellness post-exam activity was a tremendous success,
blending essential education with hands-on fun. It served as a meaningful
reminder to our students about the importance of safe, responsible online
practices. Through this event, our students have become more informed,
aware, and ready to navigate the digital world confidently and safely.</p>

<h2><strong>ECG Learning Journey to Singapore Chemical Industry Council</strong></h2>
<p>Last week, a group of Secondary Two and Three students embarked on an
enlightening learning journey to the Singapore Chemical Industry Council
(SCIC). The visit offered them a thrilling glimpse into the various facets
and opportunities within the chemical industry.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights Post/ECGLJ_SCIC2024_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>During the tour, students gained a deeper understanding of the educational
pathways and overall experiences available in this dynamic field. These
insights will be invaluable as they make informed decisions about their
post-secondary educational courses in related disciplines.</p>
<p>The visit included a comprehensive site tour, allowing students to explore
the various labs and workshops utilised by different branches within SCIC.
Additionally, the students participated in breakout sessions where they
interacted with industry facilitators. These experts shared valuable information
about potential career opportunities in the chemical industry and enthusiastically
addressed any questions the students had regarding the workings of the
chemical industry in Singapore.</p>

</div>
<p>In summary, the learning journey to SCIC provided our students with a
clearer picture of possible post-secondary educational pathways, sparking
their motivation to pursue their dream courses and careers in the chemical
industry. This experience has undoubtedly broadened their horizons and
inspired them to consider the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.</p>

<h2><strong>Secondary Two Gratitude Fair</strong></h2>
<p>So much happens every day, but how often do we notice the positive things
in our lives? There’s always something to be grateful for!</p>
<p>On 24 May 2024, we held our inaugural Gratitude Fair as a way to wrap
up Semester 1. Helmed by our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)
Champions and Secondary Two students, and supported by our Parents Support
Group (PSG), the Fair provided Regenites with a platform to express their
gratitude for the things around them.</p>
<p>At booths adorned with vibrant tinsel curtains and cheerful decorations,
Regenites learnt how to express their gratitude through a myriad of ways—from
writing thank-you notes to their loved ones to interactive activities promoting
mindfulness. They also exchanged stories of appreciation with one another
through games such as “Roll-the-Dice” and “Pick-up Sticks”. The Air Clay
booth was a kaleidoscope of colours, with our budding artists moulding
different coloured clay into one-of-a-kind masterpieces to be gifted to
their loved ones. ‘The activities at the Fair helped me to reflect on the
things I’m grateful for in my life. I particularly enjoyed the board games
at the Fair, as I was able to share and show my appreciation to my friends,’
says Muhammad Ihsan Bin Yusri (S4-Respect). For CCE Champion Xavier Chen
(S4-Determination), helming the booth was a deeply fulfilling experience.
‘It was great seeing people make gratitude cards for their friends and
loved ones. I also appreciated having the opportunity to interact with
students from the different levels at the Fair.’</p>

</div>
<p>And the fun didn’t stop there! After school, our PSG and their children
participated in a Seal Carving Workshop where they learnt how to carve
their own seals. It was certainly an afternoon well spent for many of our
participants who engaged in the delicate art of a time-honoured craft and
at the same time, also enjoyed a spot of bonding time with their family
members. The personalised seals that they brought home with them at the
end of the session will, no doubt, serve as a lasting reminder of the love
and gratitude that binds families together.</p>
<p>As Kristin Armstrong notes, ‘When we focus on our gratitude, the tide
of disappointment goes out and the tide of love rushes in.’ We hope that
the Gratitude Fair has imbued in Regenities a renewed appreciation for
life’s simple joys and the people who help make each day a little brighter.</p>

<h2><strong>Integration Programme</strong></h2>
<p>At Regent Secondary, we pride ourselves on embracing diversity and acknowledging
the unique backgrounds of our students. In the month of March this year,
we hosted a special programme dedicated to our International Students and
Permanent Residents. During this hour-long event, students had the opportunity
to share their experiences of integration within our school community.</p>
<p>In a creative and engaging manner, each student expressed their journey
of integration through Art. Using recyclable tote bags as their canvas,
they depicted elements such as food, architecture, buildings, and festive
celebrations from their respective nations or cultures. Through intricate
pencil lines and vibrant brush strokes, students not only showcased their
heritage but also discovered commonalities and differences among their
experiences.</p>
<p>The session provided an authentic and immersive platform for students
to share their unique stories with one another. It fostered a sense of
understanding, appreciation, and unity within our school community as we
embraced students of various nationalities into our school community.</p>

<h2><strong>PSL Training for Sec 4s</strong></h2>
<p>Our Secondary Four PSLs once again came together at the start of the year
to share their best practices carrying out their roles in peer helping,
peer bonding and peer influencing.</p>
<p>To help them gain the skills to be a positive influence, they were trained
on carrying out Peer Mediation. Through role playing and case studies,
they learned how to handle conflicts among peers. They also learned how
to better recognize and manage their emotions by tackling automatic negative
thoughts. With these important skills, we hope the Sec 4 PSLs will continue
to inspire and support their peers in handling their emotions.</p>
<p>The Sec 1 – 3 PSLs also started their training in T1W3. The newly inducted
PSLs will learn more about the three domains of Peer Support and Relationships,
while the Advanced PSLs learn more about how to influence their peers by
resisting negative peer pressure.</p>
<p>All the PSLs are looking forward to amplify their learning during the
upcoming Total Defence Day. Schools are a microcosm of society, and they
will be advocating Social Defence by promoting social cohesion in the classroom.
Together, we will make Regent a place where friendship thrives!</p>

<h2><strong>Cyber Wellness Ambassadors Induction Programme</strong></h2>
<p>On 21 February 2022, our newly-appointed Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors participated
in a fruitful induction programme organised by the Cyber-Wellness Committee.</p>
<p>They learnt more about the importance of advocating for civic-mindedness
online as well as how to look out for their peers as their Cyber-Wellness
Ambassadors. With the prevalence of contemporary issues such as cyberbullying,
“flaming”, and “cat-fishing”, our Ambassadors also equipped themselves
with the necessary skills to stand up for what’s right and report incidents
of online aggression promptly.</p>
<p>The session ended with our Cyber-Wellness community pledging to help make
Regent a safe place for everyone, online and offline. Here is what some
of our Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors have shared:</p>
<p>‘I pledge to do my part in not letting anyone be a victim of cyberbullying.’
(Riyan Fahrin, 1-Honour)</p>
<p>‘I pledge to help make the cyber world a positive environment for my peers
and I will help to educate others who might need help understanding the
importance of staying safe on the Internet.’ (Nur Hadirah, 2-Pride)</p>

<h2><strong>PSL Anti-Bullying Advocacy</strong></h2>
<p>At Regent Secondary School, our Peer Support Leaders play an important
role in helping to make the school a safe haven for all students. As positive
“influencers” within the student body, our PSLs also take great pride in
advocating for causes they believe in.</p>
<p>On 24 February 2022, our PSLs led their classmates in an advocacy project
against bullying. They carried out a slew of interesting activities aimed
at helping to raise awareness about and rally their peers to take a strong
stand against bullying. Some of our PSLs engaged their classmates using
Kahoot and facilitated lively discussions on the importance of being an
“upstander” against bullying, while others shared practical tips with their
classmates on how to address bullying within their spheres of influence.
Our students also came together to use their artistic talents for good,
creating anti-bullying posters and other artefacts that were displayed
beautifully in their classrooms.</p>
<p>Overall, the message is clear: Regenites will stand up and speak out against
bullying!</p>

<h2><strong>Peer Support Leaders</strong></h2>
<p>The school is a place where our students forge strong friendships, for
whom peers are paramount. Positive peer relationships facilitate the provision
of care and a sense of belonging amongst students. Such relationships can
also be powerful channels of positive influence—just take a look at our
Peer Support Leaders (PSL)!</p>
<p>Our PSLs are trained in the three domains of peer support and relationships,
to help foster bonds between students in class and provide practical help
and support. They have also learnt how to befriend others and create an
inclusive environment in Regent. Ahminrul Quraisha from 2-Empathy shared,
‘I hope that putting up a birthday wall in our class will help everyone
to include one another. Remembering one another’s birthday is just but
one step to avoid making anyone feel left out.’</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing our friendly PSLs helping to better Regent’s
vibrant and uplifting student community in their spheres of influence as
student advocates for general wellbeing!</p>
