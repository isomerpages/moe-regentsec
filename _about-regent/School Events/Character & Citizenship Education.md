<h2><strong>Integration Programme</strong></h2>
<p>At Regent Secondary, we pride ourselves on embracing diversity and acknowledging
the unique backgrounds of our students. In the month of March this year,
we hosted a special programme dedicated to our International Students and
Permanent Residents. During this hour-long event, students had the opportunity
to share their experiences of integration within our school community.</p>
<p>In a creative and engaging manner, each student expressed their journey
of integration through Art. Using recyclable tote bags as their canvas,
they depicted elements such as food, architecture, buildings, and festive
celebrations from their respective nations or cultures. Through intricate
pencil lines and vibrant brush strokes, students not only showcased their
heritage but also discovered commonalities and differences among their
experiences.</p>
<p>The session provided an authentic and immersive platform for students
to share their unique stories with one another. It fostered a sense of
understanding, appreciation, and unity within our school community as we
embraced students of various nationalities into our school community.</p>

<h2><strong>PSL Training for Sec 4s</strong></h2>
<p>Our Secondary Four PSLs once again came together at the start of the year
to share their best practices carrying out their roles in peer helping,
peer bonding and peer influencing.</p>
<p>To help them gain the skills to be a positive influence, they were trained
on carrying out Peer Mediation. Through role playing and case studies,
they learned how to handle conflicts among peers. They also learned how
to better recognize and manage their emotions by tackling automatic negative
thoughts. With these important skills, we hope the Sec 4 PSLs will continue
to inspire and support their peers in handling their emotions.</p>
<p>The Sec 1 – 3 PSLs also started their training in T1W3. The newly inducted
PSLs will learn more about the three domains of Peer Support and Relationships,
while the Advanced PSLs learn more about how to influence their peers by
resisting negative peer pressure.</p>
<p>All the PSLs are looking forward to amplify their learning during the
upcoming Total Defence Day. Schools are a microcosm of society, and they
will be advocating Social Defence by promoting social cohesion in the classroom.
Together, we will make Regent a place where friendship thrives!</p>

<h2><strong>Cyber Wellness Ambassadors Induction Programme</strong></h2>
<p>On 21 February 2022, our newly-appointed Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors participated
in a fruitful induction programme organised by the Cyber-Wellness Committee.</p>
<p>They learnt more about the importance of advocating for civic-mindedness
online as well as how to look out for their peers as their Cyber-Wellness
Ambassadors. With the prevalence of contemporary issues such as cyberbullying,
“flaming”, and “cat-fishing”, our Ambassadors also equipped themselves
with the necessary skills to stand up for what’s right and report incidents
of online aggression promptly.</p>
<p>The session ended with our Cyber-Wellness community pledging to help make
Regent a safe place for everyone, online and offline. Here is what some
of our Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors have shared:</p>
<p>‘I pledge to do my part in not letting anyone be a victim of cyberbullying.’
(Riyan Fahrin, 1-Honour)</p>
<p>‘I pledge to help make the cyber world a positive environment for my peers
and I will help to educate others who might need help understanding the
importance of staying safe on the Internet.’ (Nur Hadirah, 2-Pride)</p>

<h2><strong>PSL Anti-Bullying Advocacy</strong></h2>
<p>At Regent Secondary School, our Peer Support Leaders play an important
role in helping to make the school a safe haven for all students. As positive
“influencers” within the student body, our PSLs also take great pride in
advocating for causes they believe in.</p>
<p>On 24 February 2022, our PSLs led their classmates in an advocacy project
against bullying. They carried out a slew of interesting activities aimed
at helping to raise awareness about and rally their peers to take a strong
stand against bullying. Some of our PSLs engaged their classmates using
Kahoot and facilitated lively discussions on the importance of being an
“upstander” against bullying, while others shared practical tips with their
classmates on how to address bullying within their spheres of influence.
Our students also came together to use their artistic talents for good,
creating anti-bullying posters and other artefacts that were displayed
beautifully in their classrooms.</p>
<p>Overall, the message is clear: Regenites will stand up and speak out against
bullying!</p>

<h2><strong>Peer Support Leaders</strong></h2>
<p>The school is a place where our students forge strong friendships, for
whom peers are paramount. Positive peer relationships facilitate the provision
of care and a sense of belonging amongst students. Such relationships can
also be powerful channels of positive influence—just take a look at our
Peer Support Leaders (PSL)!</p>
<p>Our PSLs are trained in the three domains of peer support and relationships,
to help foster bonds between students in class and provide practical help
and support. They have also learnt how to befriend others and create an
inclusive environment in Regent. Ahminrul Quraisha from 2-Empathy shared,
‘I hope that putting up a birthday wall in our class will help everyone
to include one another. Remembering one another’s birthday is just but
one step to avoid making anyone feel left out.’</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing our friendly PSLs helping to better Regent’s
vibrant and uplifting student community in their spheres of influence as
student advocates for general wellbeing!</p>

<p>In the past few days, many of us would have been greeted by Singa’s cheery
smile as we walked into school. The Singa ambassador is an iconic sight
symbolizing the values of kindness, gratitude and graciousness in Singapore,
and has now joined the Regent Family!</p>
<p>If you have missed catching a glimpse of the photogenic lion, look no
further! Head down to the school foyer to snap some photos with the cute
ambassador stone bench!</p>
