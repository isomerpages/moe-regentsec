## **PSL Training for Sec 4s**

Our Secondary Four PSLs once again came together at the start of the year to share their best practices carrying out their roles in peer helping, peer bonding and peer influencing. 

To help them gain the skills to be a positive influence, they were trained on carrying out Peer Mediation. Through role playing and case studies, they learned how to handle conflicts among peers. They also learned how to better recognize and manage their emotions by tackling automatic negative thoughts. With these important skills, we hope the Sec 4 PSLs will continue to inspire and support their peers in handling their emotions.

The Sec 1 – 3 PSLs also started their training in T1W3. The newly inducted PSLs will learn more about the three domains of Peer Support and Relationships, while the Advanced PSLs learn more about how to influence their peers by resisting negative peer pressure. 

All the PSLs are looking forward to amplify their learning during the upcoming Total Defence Day. Schools are a microcosm of society, and they will be advocating Social Defence by promoting social cohesion in the classroom. Together, we will make Regent a place where friendship thrives!

## **Cyber Wellness Ambassadors Induction Programme**

On 21 February 2022, our newly-appointed Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors participated in a fruitful induction programme organised by the Cyber-Wellness Committee.

They learnt more about the importance of advocating for civic-mindedness online as well as how to look out for their peers as their Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors. With the prevalence of contemporary issues such as cyberbullying, “flaming”, and “cat-fishing”, our Ambassadors also equipped themselves with the necessary skills to stand up for what’s right and report incidents of online aggression promptly.

The session ended with our Cyber-Wellness community pledging to help make Regent a safe place for everyone, online and offline. Here is what some of our Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors have shared:

‘I pledge to do my part in not letting anyone be a victim of cyberbullying.’ (Riyan Fahrin, 1-Honour)

‘I pledge to help make the cyber world a positive environment for my peers and I will help to educate others who might need help understanding the importance of staying safe on the Internet.’ (Nur Hadirah, 2-Pride)

## **PSL Anti-Bullying Advocacy**

At Regent Secondary School, our Peer Support Leaders play an important role in helping to make the school a safe haven for all students. As positive “influencers” within the student body, our PSLs also take great pride in advocating for causes they believe in.

On 24 February 2022, our PSLs led their classmates in an advocacy project against bullying. They carried out a slew of interesting activities aimed at helping to raise awareness about and rally their peers to take a strong stand against bullying. Some of our PSLs engaged their classmates using Kahoot and facilitated lively discussions on the importance of being an “upstander” against bullying, while others shared practical tips with their classmates on how to address bullying within their spheres of influence. Our students also came together to use their artistic talents for good, creating anti-bullying posters and other artefacts that were displayed beautifully in their classrooms.

Overall, the message is clear: Regenites will stand up and speak out against bullying!

## **Peer Support Leaders**

The school is a place where our students forge strong friendships, for whom peers are paramount. Positive peer relationships facilitate the provision of care and a sense of belonging amongst students. Such relationships can also be powerful channels of positive influence—just take a look at our Peer Support Leaders (PSL)!

Our PSLs are trained in the three domains of peer support and relationships, to help foster bonds between students in class and provide practical help and support. They have also learnt how to befriend others and create an inclusive environment in Regent. Ahminrul Quraisha from 2-Empathy shared, ‘I hope that putting up a birthday wall in our class will help everyone to include one another. Remembering one another’s birthday is just but one step to avoid making anyone feel left out.’

We look forward to seeing our friendly PSLs helping to better Regent’s vibrant and uplifting student community in their spheres of influence as student advocates for general wellbeing!

In the past few days, many of us would have been greeted by Singa’s cheery smile as we walked into school. The Singa ambassador is an iconic sight symbolizing the values of kindness, gratitude and graciousness in Singapore, and has now joined the Regent Family!

If you have missed catching a glimpse of the photogenic lion, look no further! Head down to the school foyer to snap some photos with the cute ambassador stone bench!
