<h2><strong>UG Cadets’ Involvement in SG NDP</strong></h2>
<p>Our Regenites dazzled at this year’s National Day Parade, with Ng Han
Siang Lucas (2-Pride), Teo Chun Kai Bosco (3-Determination), and Joel Chong
En Wei (3-Empathy) from the Boys’ Brigade (BB) as well as Red Cross Youth
(RCY) cadets Nur Faaiqah Binte Junaidi (3-Determination) and Wendy Heng
Wan Xin (3-Integrity) marching with their Uniformed Group contingents in
the NDP 2024 Parade and Ceremony Segment.</p>
<p>Months of intense training culminated in a display of exceptional skill
and teamwork. From perfecting their foot drills to networking with fellow
parade participants and meeting dignitaries at the National Education (NE)
Show, our cadets were at the heart of the action! As BB boy Bosco, a two-time
parade participant, shared: ‘Meeting new friends and people from different
contingents was an incredible experience! I’m glad I chose to step up and
seize the opportunity to represent my school and CCA.</p>

<p>For RCY cadet Wendy, the parade was a testament to the values of discipline
and commitment. ‘Sacrificing so many Saturdays to train for the parade
was no mean feat, but it was worth it.’ Faaiqah echoed the sentiment of
hard work and dedication. ‘I’ve learnt that hard work and consistent effort
are crucial. Without these, the parade wouldn’t have come together as smoothly.’</p>

<h2><strong>Regent Drama Club Shines at Limbang National Day Carnival 2024</strong></h2>

patriotism, connect with fellow citizens, and reflect on our collective
achievements. This year, the Regent Drama Club proudly took part in the
Limbang National Day Carnival 2024 on August 3, showcasing their talents
and school spirit.</p>

<p>The carnival was a vibrant celebration that brought the community together,
filled with carnival rides, engaging booth games, and dynamic performances.
Our Drama Club stole the show with a captivating short play that beautifully
explored the essence of the Singapore Spirit. Their performance left the

<h2><strong>Girls' Brigade Day 2024</strong></h2>
<p>Every third Monday of July marks a special occasion at Regent Secondary
School as students and staff gather to commemorate Girls’ Brigade (GB)
Day. This year, the 81<sup>st</sup> Girls’ Brigade Company proudly celebrated
its 5<sup>th</sup> GB Day since its inception in 2020, showcasing camaraderie,
discipline, and the spirit of service that define this uniformed group.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School Events/CCA/GBDay2024_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>Under the gleaming lights in the school hall, our GB girls stood tall
in their immaculate uniforms, forming a striking tableau during the school’s
assembly parade. For many, this day was not just about ceremony but a reaffirmation
of values and dedication.</p>
<p>The highlight of the morning was the heartfelt message delivered by GB
President Ms Sharon Liat, urging the girls to embrace joy, generosity,
and the youthful spirit that defines the Girls’ Brigade. Her words resonated
deeply, reminding everyone of the enduring principles that bind the Brigade
together.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her experience as this year's parade commander, Shaynel
Peh from 3-Empathy shared her journey from nervous anticipation to triumphant
pride. ‘This year’s GB Day was my first time leading the parade in front
of the whole school, so I was very nervous. But after several rehearsals,
I gained confidence in myself and knew I could perform well on the actual
day.’</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School Events/CCA/GBDay2024_2.jpg">
</div>
<p>Indeed, Shaynel's confidence was well-placed as the parade unfolded flawlessly,
each movement a testament to the many weeks of preparation and hardwork.
‘I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I executed my duties without
any errors. I am incredibly proud of my company for giving their best.’</p>
<p>The day concluded with cheers and applause, marking not just a milestone
for our 81<sup>st</sup> GB Company but a reaffirmation of the values of
leadership, service, and unity that define our school’s community spirit.</p>

<h2><strong>National Police Cadet Corp &amp; World Red Cross Day Parade 2024</strong></h2>
<p>10 May 2024 was a momentous occasion for our National Police Cadet Corps
(NPCC) and Red Cross Youth (RCY) units, who came together to mark NPCC
Day and World Red Cross Day with a joint parade.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School Events/CCA/NPCC_WrldRCDayParade2024_1.jpg">
</div>
<p>With their unit flags flying high, our NPCC and RCY cadets reaffirmed
their commitment to serving the country and community with utmost dedication.
It was also a proud moment for our Secondary One cadets, who were participating
in a parade for the very first time—and to a live audience, no less. ‘I
enjoyed being a part of the parade. Commemorating NPCC Day with my CCA
mates allowed me to reflect on my time in the unit thus far and reaffirm
my commitment to giving my best during our training sessions,’ notes NPCC
cadet Asher Lim (S1-Integrity).</p>

<h2><strong>BB Blaze</strong></h2>
<p>Cadets from the Boys’ Brigade (BB) took part in BB Blaze, a fitness and
adventure competition cum endurance race on 6 April. The boys embarked
on a formidable journey spanning 20 kilometres across Singapore, completing
an array of physical challenges incorporating sports such as archery and
kayaking, as well as a demanding obstacle course that saw them scaling
over high walls and cargo nets. Participants were also assessed on their
First Aid and micro-navigation skills—core components of the BB badgework
curriculum.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce that our team comprising Officer Shaun Kok
and cadets Keith Ang (4-Pride), Carvel Chua (4-Respect), and Ip Seng Choo
(2-Determination) clinched the Championship title in the BB Blaze (Open
Category)! We are proud of the indomitable spirit displayed by all cadets
who participated in this challenge, which has no doubt been a thrilling
and meaningful one. As winner Seng Choo notes, ‘While the weather was scorching
and the race was arduous, the experience was immensely fulfilling for me.
I was able to bond with my seniors, discover more of Singapore’s charms,
and engage in thrilling activities such as kayaking, archery, and high
elements. Being pitted against fellow BB participants from various other
institutions fueled my motivation. The event was an absolute blast, especially
since I helped my team secure first place in the open category, making
all our sacrifices worthwhile.’</p>
<p>Congratulations to the 91st Company on your wonderful achievements!</p>

<h2><strong>Uniformed Groups Passing-Out Parade 2024</strong></h2>
<p>Thundery showers notwithstanding, our Uniformed Group (UG) leaders took
centre-stage at our annual Passing-Out Parade on 12 April 2024, an important
milestone for all graduating UG cadets. The Change of Command was executed
smoothly with our Principal, Mrs Sng, and the Regent community bearing
witness to this momentous occasion. For Parade Commander Warrant Officer
Gregg Loo, the parade was certainly a moment to cherish, having played
an instrumental role as Boys’ Brigade Company Sergeant Major and Head of
the Uniformed Groups over the past two years.</p>
<p>Turning to face the Singapore flag one last time as one contingent, the
sense of camaraderie shared by our senior UG cadets—having stood shoulder
to shoulder many a time over the last few years—was palpable. Truly, we
would like to thank our graduating batch of UG leaders and cadets for their
selfless contributions to the CCA and school community. Taking the helm
of our four UGs are: Sergeant Josiah Eang (BB), Corporal Shaynel Peh (GB),
Corporal Kee Yi Ling (NPCC), and Corporal Sing Jia Qian (RCY). Congratulations!</p>

<h2><strong>Red Cross Youth First Aid Championships 2024</strong></h2>
<p>Our Red Cross Youth cadets showcased their expertise and commitment to
first aid at the recent First Aid Championships, a prestigious national
competition organised by the Singapore Red Cross. This event serves as
a platform to emphasize the vital role of first aid skills in our cadets.</p>
<p>The competition, held on March 2, 2024, attracted hundreds of participants
from various schools, all eager to demonstrate their proficiency in handling
simulated emergencies within timed conditions. Prior to the Championships,
our cadets underwent intensive training workshops, where they refined their
critical thinking, problem-solving, and case management abilities.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges posed during the Championships, our cadets exhibited
remarkable resilience and teamwork throughout the competition. Their efforts
culminated in a significant achievement, as they emerged as one of the
top 12 finalists—a new record for our unit. Furthermore, they were honoured
with the Gold award for their adept handling of a diverse range of critical
scenarios.</p>
<p>We extend our heartfelt appreciation to our dedicated teachers and Volunteer
Instructors for their unwavering support throughout this journey. Their
guidance and encouragement played a pivotal role in our cadets' success.
With great enthusiasm, we eagerly anticipate participating in next year's
edition, furthering our commitment to promoting the importance of first
aid education in our cadets.</p>

<h2><strong>Girls Brigade Commemoration Day 2023</strong></h2>
<p>The Enrolment and Dedication Ceremony is conducted annually to induct
Girls’ Brigade members and leaders into the company. The enrolment service
was held in Regent Secondary School on 15th April 2023. It was a product
of the joint effort of both the 91st Boys’ Brigade and 81st Girls’ Brigade,
and kindly supported by Bukit Panjang Gospel Chapel.</p>
<p>This year, we are grateful to have our Principal, Mrs Sng, as our Guest-of-Honour.
The cadets trained hard for their drills in preparation for the uniform
inspection. On top of that, the Girls’ Brigade also rehearsed diligently
for the presentation of their drill competition performance.</p>
<p>Cayden Goh Way Ee, a Boys' Brigade cadet from 2-Respect, was proud to
be part of the marching contingent. He also felt that this ceremony had
created opportunities for him and his fellow cadets to foster stronger
bonds.</p>
<p>Girls' Brigade cadet Chai Weng Xin from 3-Integrity said, “This year's
Enrolment and Dedication ceremony is special for me as I was appointed
the Company Leader. Not only that, I also took part in the drill competition.
My parents were present at the ceremony and were proud to see my performance.
I was thankful to have them witness this special occasion.”</p>
<p>This ceremony serves to build a sense of commitment in our students as
they take on new roles in their journey with their respective companies.
We would like to wish our students the very best as they navigate the new
and exciting journey ahead!</p>

<h2><strong>NSG Ceremony 2023</strong></h2>
<p>On 3 February 2023, our school held a National School Games (NSG) Ceremony
for our student athletes who are participating in the NSG tournament this
year.</p>
<p>Amidst deafening applause, representatives from our Sports and Games CCAs,
namely Badminton, Basketball, Football, Netball and Taekwondo, walked down
the centre aisle of the school hall with great pride and honour.</p>
<p>The highlight of the ceremony focused on the motto, “Character in Sporting
Excellence”, where our Sports and Games CCA Leader, Emily Cheu from 4-Integrity
led the student athletes to recite the Athletes’ oath as a reminder to
uphold the virtues of sportsmanship in the tournament.</p>
<p>The ceremony culminated with the presentation of the school jerseys by
our Principal, Mrs Sng, to the captains of each team. The jersey presentation
symbolises our school values of Passion, Respect, Integrity, Determination
and Empathy (P.R.I.D.E.), which our student athletes will embody as they
don the school colours for each game.</p>
<p>We would like to wish our Sports and Games CCAs the very best as they
compete in this year’s National School Games. May they “Blaze Forth To
Glory”!</p>

<h2><strong>Sec 4 UG Passing-Out Parade 2023</strong></h2>
<p>The Passing Out Parade (POP) is a ceremony for cadets that is held when
they complete their term in their respective Uniformed Groups (UGs). It
is one of the many important and unique milestones that cadets in UGs experience.</p>
<p>This year, the Secondary Four cadets from all 4 UGs (Boys’ Brigade, Girls’
Brigade, National Police Cadet Corps, and Red Cross Youth) were appointed
as Guard of Honour. The Parade Commander is Yuki Khoo (4-Empathy) from
the Girls’ Brigade and the Regimental Commander is Edmund Teo Jia Jing
(4-Gratitude) from the Red Cross Youth.</p>
<p>Parade Commander Yuki Khoo shared, “When I first heard that I was going
to be the Parade Commander for this year’s Passing Out Parade, I was both
nervous and excited. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With the
help and support of the other Uniformed Group (UG) heads, I am confident
that I would make this parade a success. I would like to thank all the
cadets for giving me the chance to be the Parade Commander and the teachers
for their guidance and patience.”</p>
<p>With the school as witness, the leadership handover ceremony was conducted
on 5 April 2023. This ceremony signifies the passing of the baton to the
next batch of leaders from the Secondary Three unit, trusting that they
will uphold the responsibility to lead the future cadets and serve the
school.</p>
<p>Congratulations to our graduating cadets and we wish our new cadet leaders
the very best in their future endeavours!</p>

<h2><strong>Secondary One CCA Orientation – CCA Experience 2023</strong></h2>
<p>Co-Curricular Activities are an integral part of student life in Regent
Secondary School. Our newest additions to the Regent family—our Secondary
One students—had a taste of our vibrant CCA programme with CCA Experience
Day, which was held over four sessions in January.</p>
<p>Students had the opportunity to participate in activities from the four
CCA groups (Clubs and Societies, Performing Arts, Sports and Games, and
Uniformed Groups), and our energetic Secondary Two to Four Regenites pulled
out all stops to showcase their CCAs with game booths, quizzes, and other
experiential activities. Needless to say, our Secondary Ones had an enriching
time learning more about what each CCA has to offer and mingling with their
seniors!</p>

<h2><strong>BB &amp; GB Outdoor Activities</strong></h2>
<p>School’s out… Adventure’s in!</p>
<p>On 26 February 2022, our Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade companies participated
in their first adventure outing of the year — kayaking and standup paddleboarding
at the BB/GB campsite!</p>
<p>It was truly a day of fun in the sun for many of our boys and girls. For
Tan Hao Yu (1-Pride), he enjoyed the feeling of being in the water as he
had not been to the pool for a long time since the start of the pandemic.
Shaynel Peh (1-Gratitude) even made some new friends during the kayaking
activity! Though Kayden Lim (2-Gratitude) was initially apprehensive about
being able to paddleboard successfully, he managed to maneuver the paddleboard
confidently over the course of the activity, and had a whale of a time.</p>
<p>There’s never a dull moment at CCA for our BB and GB cadets, and they
can certainly look forward to many more exciting adventures in the weeks
to come!</p>

<p>The Singapore Youth Festival – SYF Arts Presentation (Secondary School)
is a biannual event organised to celebrate the vitality of our youth and
their diverse arts talents.</p>
<p>The SYF Arts Presentation aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>develop cultural awareness and appreciation through aesthetics education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serve as a platform for the development of character through the arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage mass participation in arts (CCAs) in schools</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For all Performing Arts students in Regent Secondary School, SYF is one
of the main highlights of their time in CCA. The students from the English
Drama, Modern Dance, Concert Band and Show Choir dedicated many weeks and
months of hard work to showcase their passion for the Arts. Learning to
use body language to tell meaningful stories, sing in harmony, move in
synchronized actions and fine-tune articulations were definitely not easy
but our students were resilient and determined to achieve excellence. The
preparation for this highly anticipated event was truly tiring, but the
process was well worth it. The students grew to become stronger performers,
developed a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Arts and forged
stronger relationships with their peers, teachers, seniors and instructors.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at how Regent Secondary School’s Performing Arts students
prepared themselves to participate at this year’s SYF. Do continue to support
our Performing Arts members and we wish them all the best. Let’s Blaze
Forth to Glory!</p>
