<h2><strong>CCA Led Gratitude Challenge</strong></h2>
<p>On 12 March 2025, Regent Secondary launched its first-ever CCA-led Gratitude
Challenge, an initiative designed to encourage students to express appreciation
for their peers and school community. In their respective Co-Curricular
Activity (CCA) groups, students took part in a series of meaningful gratitude-themed
activities, including Gratitude Bingo, Gratitude Chains, and Gratitude
Cards.</p>
<p>In Gratitude Bingo, students completed a sheet filled with simple yet
powerful acts of gratitude, such as thanking a friend or offering words
of kindness. This activity encouraged them to be mindful of the small but
impactful ways they could show appreciation daily.</p>

<p>The Gratitude Chain saw students writing heartfelt messages on paper strips
about peers, teachers, or memorable school experiences. These strips were
then linked together to form a colorful chain—a symbol of how appreciation
strengthens relationships and connects the school community. Similarly,
the Gratitude Cards activity allowed students to express their appreciation
through personal, handwritten notes to their CCA teammates. Emma Rose from
Red Cross Youth reflected on this experience, saying, “<em>I think that the CCE Gratitude Challenge was able to strengthen the existing bonds our CCA has for each other by expressing our gratefulness to them on cards.</em>”
These simple gestures created a warm and uplifting atmosphere as students
shared their thanks in meaningful ways.</p>

<p>Throughout the 35-minute session, students laughed, shared stories, and
actively engaged in showing appreciation. Many found it to be a refreshing
break from the usual CCE lessons, allowing them to interact with their
CCA peers in a more personal and heartfelt manner. Ho Ming Yuan Daniel
from English Drama shared, “<em>I felt that the CCA-led Gratitude Challenge was very fun as it really allowed me to bond with the members in my CCA. I would say it benefited me and the CCA quite a lot as now we get to know each other better and grow closer.</em>”</p>

<p>By the end of the event, the school was buzzing with positivity and renewed
appreciation. The CCA-led Gratitude Challenge was not just about saying
“Thank You”—it was about recognising and celebrating one another’s contributions,
reinforcing the school’s values of empathy, respect, and community spirit.</p>
