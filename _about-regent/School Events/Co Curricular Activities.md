## **Girls Brigade Commemoration Day 2023**

The Enrolment and Dedication Ceremony is conducted annually to induct Girls’ Brigade members and leaders into the company. The enrolment service was held in Regent Secondary School on 15th April 2023. It was a product of the joint effort of both the 91st Boys’ Brigade and 81st Girls’ Brigade, and kindly supported by Bukit Panjang Gospel Chapel. 

This year, we are grateful to have our Principal, Mrs Sng, as our Guest-of-Honour. The cadets trained hard for their drills in preparation for the uniform inspection. On top of that, the Girls’ Brigade also rehearsed diligently for the presentation of their drill competition performance.

Cayden Goh Way Ee, a Boys' Brigade cadet from 2-Respect, was proud to be part of the marching contingent. He also felt that this ceremony had created opportunities for him and his fellow cadets to foster stronger bonds.

Girls' Brigade cadet Chai Weng Xin from 3-Integrity said, “This year's Enrolment and Dedication ceremony is special for me as I was appointed the Company Leader. Not only that, I also took part in the drill competition. My parents were present at the ceremony and were proud to see my performance. I was thankful to have them witness this special occasion.”
 
This ceremony serves to build a sense of commitment in our students as they take on new roles in their journey with their respective companies. We would like to wish our students the very best as they navigate the new and exciting journey ahead!

## **NSG Ceremony 2023**

On 3 February 2023, our school held a National School Games (NSG) Ceremony for our student athletes who are participating in the NSG tournament this year. 

Amidst deafening applause, representatives from our Sports and Games CCAs, namely Badminton, Basketball, Football, Netball and Taekwondo, walked down the centre aisle of the school hall with great pride and honour.

The highlight of the ceremony focused on the motto, “Character in Sporting Excellence”, where our Sports and Games CCA Leader, Emily Cheu from 4-Integrity led the student athletes to recite the Athletes’ oath as a reminder to uphold the virtues of sportsmanship in the tournament.

The ceremony culminated with the presentation of the school jerseys by our Principal, Mrs Sng, to the captains of each team. The jersey presentation symbolises our school values of Passion, Respect, Integrity, Determination and Empathy (P.R.I.D.E.), which our student athletes will embody as they don the school colours for each game.

We would like to wish our Sports and Games CCAs the very best as they compete in this year’s National School Games. May they “Blaze Forth To Glory”!

## **Sec 4 UG Passing-Out Parade 2023**

The Passing Out Parade (POP) is a ceremony for cadets that is held when they complete their term in their respective Uniformed Groups (UGs). It is one of the many important and unique milestones that cadets in UGs experience.

This year, the Secondary Four cadets from all 4 UGs (Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade, National Police Cadet Corps, and Red Cross Youth) were appointed as Guard of Honour. The Parade Commander is Yuki Khoo (4-Empathy) from the Girls’ Brigade and the Regimental Commander is Edmund Teo Jia Jing (4-Gratitude) from the Red Cross Youth.

Parade Commander Yuki Khoo shared, “When I first heard that I was going to be the Parade Commander for this year’s Passing Out Parade, I was both nervous and excited. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. With the help and support of the other Uniformed Group (UG) heads, I am confident that I would make this parade a success. I would like to thank all the cadets for giving me the chance to be the Parade Commander and the teachers for their guidance and patience.”

With the school as witness, the leadership handover ceremony was conducted on 5 April 2023. This ceremony signifies the passing of the baton to the next batch of leaders from the Secondary Three unit, trusting that they will uphold the responsibility to lead the future cadets and serve the school.

Congratulations to our graduating cadets and we wish our new cadet leaders the very best in their future endeavours!

## **Secondary One CCA Orientation – CCA Experience 2023**

Co-Curricular Activities are an integral part of student life in Regent Secondary School. Our newest additions to the Regent family—our Secondary One students—had a taste of our vibrant CCA programme with CCA Experience Day, which was held over four sessions in January. 

Students had the opportunity to participate in activities from the four CCA groups (Clubs and Societies, Performing Arts, Sports and Games, and Uniformed Groups), and our energetic Secondary Two to Four Regenites pulled out all stops to showcase their CCAs with game booths, quizzes, and other experiential activities. Needless to say, our Secondary Ones had an enriching time learning more about what each CCA has to offer and mingling with their seniors!

Today, Regent’s BB Boys don their uniform proudly and commemorates the event with a parade for the new Secondary One students at the school parade square.

## **BB &amp; GB Outdoor Activities**

School’s out… Adventure’s in!

On 26 February 2022, our Boys’ and Girls’ Brigade companies participated in their first adventure outing of the year — kayaking and standup paddleboarding at the BB/GB campsite!

It was truly a day of fun in the sun for many of our boys and girls. For Tan Hao Yu (1-Pride), he enjoyed the feeling of being in the water as he had not been to the pool for a long time since the start of the pandemic. Shaynel Peh (1-Gratitude) even made some new friends during the kayaking activity! Though Kayden Lim (2-Gratitude) was initially apprehensive about being able to paddleboard successfully, he managed to maneuver the paddleboard confidently over the course of the activity, and had a whale of a time.

There’s never a dull moment at CCA for our BB and GB cadets, and they can certainly look forward to many more exciting adventures in the weeks to come!

## **Regent Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2021**

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhJvwyq5L6g" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

The Singapore Youth Festival – SYF Arts Presentation (Secondary School) is a biannual event organised to celebrate the vitality of our youth and their diverse arts talents.

The SYF Arts Presentation aims to:

*   develop cultural awareness and appreciation through aesthetics education
*   serve as a platform for the development of character through the arts
*   encourage mass participation in arts (CCAs) in schools

For all Performing Arts students in Regent Secondary School, SYF is one of the main highlights of their time in CCA. The students from the English Drama, Modern Dance, Concert Band and Show Choir dedicated many weeks and months of hard work to showcase their passion for the Arts. Learning to use body language to tell meaningful stories, sing in harmony, move in synchronized actions and fine-tune articulations were definitely not easy but our students were resilient and determined to achieve excellence. The preparation for this highly anticipated event was truly tiring, but the process was well worth it. The students grew to become stronger performers, developed a deeper understanding and appreciation of the Arts and forged stronger relationships with their peers, teachers, seniors and instructors.

Let us take a look at how Regent Secondary School’s Performing Arts students prepared themselves to participate at this year’s SYF. Do continue to support our Performing Arts members and we wish them all the best. Let’s Blaze Forth to Glory!

**SYF Arts Presentation Dates:**

*   Concert Band (1st&nbsp;and 5th&nbsp;April 2021)
*   English Drama (14th&nbsp;April 2021)
*   Modern Dance (15th&nbsp;April 2021)
