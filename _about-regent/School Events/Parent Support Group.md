## **Parents Support Group BBQ**

About 100 Parent Support Group (PSG) members, students and staff of Regent Secondary School gathered at the school canteen on 25 June 2022 for the first face-to-face event since the COVID-19 pandemic - the eagerly awaited BBQ!

The PSG EXCO had spent time preparing the food lists, bonding activities, BBQ set-up and the invite messages for the various parent chat groups to ensure an interesting line-up of activities for all.

There was much enthusiasm as PSG members started trickling in at 5pm, with their family members in tow. Our Principal, Mr Leong, welcomed them warmly and shared the school’s focus with them. Things got “heated up” as the smoky aroma of charcoal filled the air and an appetizing spread of food was laid out for the guests. They were also entertained by lively music and interesting ice-breakers and games, helmed by the PSG EXCO.

It was indeed a relaxing time of bonding with family members and with one another. The evening culminated with a family photo of all present at the school parade square and 3 cheers.

We look forward to the next bonding session!
