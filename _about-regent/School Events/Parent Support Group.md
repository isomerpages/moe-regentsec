<h2><strong>PSG Bake &amp; Bond</strong></h2>
<p>To commemorate Mother's Day, on 13th May, three CCAs, namely the Boys'
Brigade, Girls' Brigade, and Environmental Science Club and the Food &amp;
Nutrition Unit partnered with our Parent Support Group to host a special
Mother’s Day event. This event aims to provide parents and children with
the opportunity and space to bond and have fun with one another. The fun-filled
day began as early birds partake in various exciting activities, such as
Trivia Quiz and Toss Balls.</p>

<p>Next, parents and students were ushered to the food labs where they cooked
up a storm, perfecting their cupcake mix before putting them into the oven.
Wasting no time at all, members of the Environmental Science Club taught
the parent-child teams to make delicate, dainty paper flowers as participants
waited for their soft, velvety cupcakes to be baked to perfection. Saving
the best for last, the families gleefully frosted their cupcakes with fluffy,
fresh cream, before taking a group photo to commemorate this eventful day
with their prized handicrafts and desserts!</p>
<p>It was heartening for us to see our parents and students enjoying themselves!
Orlando Aloysius Battista mentioned, “The best inheritance a parent can
give his children is a few minutes of his time each day.” We hope this
day gave these families lasting memories, ones that they will recall fondly
of in the future! We would also like to take this opportunity to thank
all the caring and courageous mothers for tirelessly braving the daily
challenges! Regent Secondary School wishes all the mothers out there a
very happy Mother's Day!</p>

<h2><strong>Parents Support Group&nbsp;BBQ</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<p>About 100 Parent Support Group (PSG) members, students and staff of Regent
Secondary School gathered at the school canteen on 25 June 2022 for the
first face-to-face event since the COVID-19 pandemic - the eagerly awaited&nbsp;BBQ!</p>

<p>The&nbsp;PSG&nbsp;EXCO had spent time preparing the food lists, bonding
activities,&nbsp;BBQ&nbsp;set-up and the invite messages for the various
parent chat groups to ensure an interesting line-up of activities for all.</p>
<p>There was much enthusiasm as&nbsp;PSG&nbsp;members started trickling in
at 5pm, with their family members in tow. Our Principal, Mr Leong, welcomed
them warmly and shared the school’s focus with them. Things got “heated
up” as the smoky aroma of charcoal filled the air and an appetizing spread
of food was laid out for the guests. They were also entertained by lively
music and interesting ice-breakers and games, helmed by the&nbsp;PSG&nbsp;EXCO.</p>
<p>It was indeed a relaxing time of bonding with family members and with
one another. The evening culminated with a family photo of all present
at the school parade square and 3 cheers.</p>
<p>We look forward to the next bonding session!</p>
