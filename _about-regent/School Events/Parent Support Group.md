<p>On Saturday, 17th May, Regent Secondary School was abuzz with joy and
laughter as 37 families came together for a meaningful Mother’s Day Parent-Child
Bonding Activity. Organised in collaboration with the Parent Support Group
(PSG) and our four Uniformed Groups—The Boys’ Brigade, The Girls’ Brigade,
the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), and Red Cross Youth—the event aimed
to strengthen family ties through engaging and creative activities.</p>
<p>Families arrived early, brimming with excitement. The morning began with
an array of carnival-style game booths crafted and manned by our Uniformed
Groups. Participants enjoyed a variety of activities such as improvised
bowling, target shooting, and First Aid bandaging. These games brought
smiles and laughter to both parents and children, setting a lively and
cheerful tone for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>The highlight of the event was a cookie baking session held in the school’s
Food Lab. Guided by staff from the Nutrition and Food Science Department,
families teamed up to bake delicious chocolate chip cookies—a treat they
could enjoy together and take home as a sweet memento.</p>

<p>In a nod to sustainability, members of the Environmental Science Club
led a creative workshop on upcycling toilet rolls to make handcrafted paper
flowers. This eco-friendly activity gave children the opportunity to express
their love and appreciation through art, while learning about recycling
and resourcefulness.</p>

<p>The NPCC cadets rounded off the programme with an informative segment
on SGSecure, raising awareness of the importance of community vigilance.
Families then took part in a Kahoot quiz, turning learning into a fun and
interactive experience.</p>
<p>The morning concluded with a group photo at the school canteen, capturing
the smiles and spirit of camaraderie shared throughout the event. It was
truly a meaningful and heartwarming day—one filled with joy, teamwork,
and lasting memories for all families involved.</p>

<h2><strong>PSG Bake &amp; Bond</strong></h2>
<p>To commemorate Mother's Day, on 13th May, three CCAs, namely the Boys'
Brigade, Girls' Brigade, and Environmental Science Club and the Food &amp;
Nutrition Unit partnered with our Parent Support Group to host a special
Mother’s Day event. This event aims to provide parents and children with
the opportunity and space to bond and have fun with one another. The fun-filled
day began as early birds partake in various exciting activities, such as
Trivia Quiz and Toss Balls.</p>

<p>Next, parents and students were ushered to the food labs where they cooked
up a storm, perfecting their cupcake mix before putting them into the oven.
Wasting no time at all, members of the Environmental Science Club taught
the parent-child teams to make delicate, dainty paper flowers as participants
waited for their soft, velvety cupcakes to be baked to perfection. Saving
the best for last, the families gleefully frosted their cupcakes with fluffy,
fresh cream, before taking a group photo to commemorate this eventful day
with their prized handicrafts and desserts!</p>
<p>It was heartening for us to see our parents and students enjoying themselves!
Orlando Aloysius Battista mentioned, “The best inheritance a parent can
give his children is a few minutes of his time each day.” We hope this
day gave these families lasting memories, ones that they will recall fondly
of in the future! We would also like to take this opportunity to thank
all the caring and courageous mothers for tirelessly braving the daily
challenges! Regent Secondary School wishes all the mothers out there a
very happy Mother's Day!</p>
