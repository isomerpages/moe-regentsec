<h2><strong>Total Defence Day 2025</strong></h2>
<p>Regent Secondary School observed Total Defence Day with engaging activities,
including the Exercise SG Ready initiative. A key highlight was the water
disruption exercise, which allowed students to experience the inconvenience
of limited water access, reinforcing the importance of preparedness. The
school also conducted a Lockdown Drill as part of Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) lessons, ensuring students are equipped to handle security
threats.</p>

<p>The event featured a Total Defence Day Parade led by the Uniformed Groups,
symbolizing discipline and national defence. They also shared insights
on the five pillars of Total Defence, emphasizing the role of every individual
in safeguarding Singapore. Through these experiences, students gained a
deeper appreciation for resilience, self-reliance, and collective responsibility
in keeping the nation secure.</p>

<h2><strong>Celebrating Racial Harmony Day at Regent Secondary School</strong></h2>
<p>Last week, our Regenites were filled with anticipation as we commemorated
Racial Harmony Day (RHD) on 16 July 2024. RHD holds significant importance
as it marks the anniversary of the 1964 race riots, reminding us of the
journey towards a harmonious Singaporean society, rich in cultural diversity
and social cohesion.</p>
<p>This year, the theme for Racial Harmony Day was "Singapore: Our Multicultural
Mosaic." It was chosen to prompt our students to contemplate how each community
intertwines to create Singapore's unique cultural tapestry, while also
honoring each community's distinct identity within our nation.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School Events/National Education/RHD2024_2.jpg">
</div>
<p>To celebrate this theme, we organised our inaugural Regent Fashion Show.
Each class enthusiastically designed and crafted modern ethnic wear using
recycled materials. These stunning costumes were proudly displayed on our
very own model catwalk during our school's mass assembly.</p>
<p>Adding to the vibrant celebration, our Modern Dance club performed an
energetic routine that incorporated dance moves from various Singaporean
cultures. Meanwhile, our Parents Support Group set up an interesting booth
at the canteen where students could experience traditional delights such
as ‘kacang puteh’ and participate in traditional games.</p>
<p>The day was a true celebration of learning and cultural appreciation for
our Regenites. It provided a platform for them to embrace the richness
of Singapore's multiculturalism and reflect on the importance of harmony
in our diverse society.</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing to foster understanding and appreciation
for Singapore's cultural diversity in the years to come. Thank you to everyone
who made this Racial Harmony Day at Regent a memorable and enriching experience!</p>

<h2><strong>International Friendship Day 2024</strong></h2>
<p>Our Regenites were in high spirits as they were treated to several performances
that commemorated International Friendship Day.</p>
<p>They were first regaled by the jaunty tunes of two pieces of songs played
live by our very own Regent Pop Band. Our audience gamely clapped along
to "Lemak Manis", a traditional Malay timeless classic of Malaysian music
appreciated for its poetic lyrics, melodious composition, and emotive performance,
and to "Pasilyo", a song well-known as a “wedding anthem” because of the
promise of eternal love that it expresses.</p>
<p>The highlight of the day was the panel sharing held by our very own international
students. The six students warmly welcomed questions on their experiences
of living in Singapore and shared the struggles they encountered while
adapting to our Singaporean culture.</p>
<p>It was an eye-opening session indeed for our Regenites learning about
the important role Singapore plays in ASEAN and fostering stronger friendships
with their international classmates.</p>

<h2><strong>Total Defence Day 2024</strong></h2>
<p>2024 marks 40 years of Total Defence (TD40) in Singapore and we commemorated
TD40 with an exciting line-up of programmes in Regent Secondary School.</p>
<p>In keeping with this year’s theme, ‘Together We Keep Singapore Strong’,
our Cyberwellness Representatives and Peer Support Leaders shared with
their classmates on the ways Total Defence can be put into action. This
rich sharing on the pillars of Digital Defence and Social Defence were
done through informative and engaging presentations.</p>
<p>Our annual Total Defence Day Parade also exemplified this spirit of togetherness,
with cadets from our four Uniformed Groups—the Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade,
National Police Cadet Corps, and Red Cross Youth—coming together in a show
of strength and unity, similar to the many social groups that make up Singapore.
Our cadets also put together awareness campaigns on the pillars of Civil
Defence, Military Defence, and Social Defence and exhorted their peers
to do their part for our nation.</p>
<p>In addition to the exploration of the Total Defence game booths that were
set up by our National Education Ambassadors and alumni, Regenites also
participated in the inaugural run of Exercise SG Ready. It is an island
wide Total Defence exercise aimed at enhancing Singaporeans’ readiness
in times of crisis and disruptions. A food supply disruption simulation
exercise was also carried out in the school on 16 February, with the usual
canteen fare replaced with shelf-stable, ready-to-eat meals that featured
novel ingredients like plant-based seafood and local produce such as abalone
mushroom and barramundi. With climate change and supply chain disruptions
which are a growing reality in our world today, our students through the
Exercise, learnt more about Singapore’s efforts to boost food security
and the importance of being able to adapt, adjust, and remain resilient
in the face of crises.</p>

<p>As Regent celebrated Singapore’s 58th birthday, we reflected upon this
year’s national day theme, “Onward As One”, which calls upon Singaporeans
to look forward confidently while moving onward together in building our
shared future as one united people.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>The day started off magnificently at the parade square as the school gathered
for the Observance Ceremony. The marching of our Uniformed Group cadets
symbolically exemplified the notion of Regenites "moving onward as one.
The Concert Band kept our spirits high with their live performance, especially
as we came together “as one” while singing the national anthem and reciting
the “Recollections.” Show Choir’s melodic singing of “My Nation, My Home”
raised our determination to rise above all challenges that lie ahead.</p>

<p>During CCE lesson, the lower secondary students had a chance to reflect
upon the importance of our day-to-day interactions in building a sense
of belonging while the upper secondary students pondered upon our strengths
and areas for improvements in building inclusivity and unity in Singapore.
The lessons impressed upon the importance of playing our part in moving
onward as one.</p>

<p>After the CCE lesson, the school gathered once again in the hall for the
National Day Celebration, where we relished the enjoyable performance put
up by our Regent Pop Band as well as the Show Choir. We also looked back
fondly at the various leadership and community outreach programmes which
allowed us to give back to the community. It was uplifting to hear from
our lower secondary students what they love about Singapore in the Regent
Rave National Day segment. The concert ended on a high note as Regenites
took part in a lively gameshow “Do Not Forget the Lyrics – National Day
Edition.” The whole school was reverberating in joy while singing in unison
to our favourite national day songs, led by Show Choir members and some
of our beloved teachers!</p>

<h2><strong>Racial Harmony Day 2023</strong></h2>
<p>Regent Secondary School celebrates Racial Harmony Day with a series of
cross-cultural activities conducted over the duration of a week.</p>
<p>Firstly, our National Education (NE) ambassadors shared their experience
participating in Quest for Harmony heritage trail with the school.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/RHD2023-2.jpg">
</div>
<p>Next, we also invited Interaction Arts and Drama Network to our school
to stage the drama performance, Hope: A Lost Phone, to share the importance
of respecting and embracing different ethnicities, and upholding racial
harmony in our society.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/RHD2023-3.jpg">
</div>
<p>Finally, booths were also set up in the canteen by our NE ambassadors
and Parent Support Group (PSG). There, our NE ambassadors shared interesting
facts about the various places of worship of different ethnic groups. Regenites
also had fun sampling the ethnic snacks, with many enjoying themselves
thoroughly as they tried out different traditional games at our PSG booths.</p>
<p>Student Tay Jin Yi from 4-Empathy remarked, “Celebrating Racial Harmony
Day is truly an imperative occasion where many Singaporeans of different
race, language and religion come together to celebrate our differences.
It was truly a wonderful experience to experience the sense of national
identity in Singapore.”</p>
<p>As PM Lee said, "There is nothing natural about where we are - multiracial,
multi-religious, tolerant and progressive. We made it happen, and we have
got to protect it, nurture it, preserve it, and never break it." We hope
that this week-long event will remind Regenites of the need to stand united
as one country, and guide them to recognise that multiculturalism is the
key to our strength and progress as a nation.</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>International Friendship Day 2023</strong></h2>
<p>International Friendship Day recognises the role that friendship plays
in promoting peace amongst various cultures. We kicked off this year’s
celebrations with a special edition of Regent Rave, an online Assembly
programme showcasing the experiences of four students who come from ASEAN
countries like Myanmar, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand. It was
fascinating to hear these students share personal anecdotes, which paint
a vivid picture of life and tradition in their home countries. As different
as these countries may seem, what was apparent from the presentation was
a shared love for food—the common thread that arguably binds us all Asians
together!</p>
<p>The theme of ‘unity in diversity’ came alive for Regenites too on the
second day of the programme, where they were treated to a handbell performance
in the school hall. Students had an enjoyable time listening to creative
renditions of popular tunes which fused Asian and Western instruments for
a truly delightful musical experience. They also got the chance to try
their hand at creating music with the handbells!</p>
<p>A week-long exhibition at the Canteen further impressed upon Regenites
the challenges and opportunities faced by Singapore in Asia. Being uniquely
positioned in a time where change is afoot regionally and globally, Singapore
faces several vulnerabilities, and it is important that we continue to
maintain positive diplomatic relations with our neighbours and the world
at large.</p>
<p>All in all, we hope that Regenites come away from the programme with a
heightened understanding of global issues and a renewed sense of purpose
in their role as future-ready global citizens!</p>

<h2><strong>Total Defence Day 2023</strong></h2>
<p>We commemorated Total Defence Day this year with a slew of activities
aimed at rallying Regenites together in responding to challenges that may
threaten Singapore’s stability.</p>
<p>The week began with an informative presentation by our Peer Support Leaders,
who shared with their classmates practical tips on strengthening social
cohesion. Then, on 15 February, our Uniformed Group cadets came together
to put up a fine display of unity with a Total Defence Day Parade. They
also helmed a special programme to promote awareness of the pillars of
Total Defence amongst their peers, with engaging presentations on basic
first aid skills and the Public Warning System. To educate Regenites on
being secure, alert, and responsible online, our Cyberwellness Ambassadors
put up an array of interesting exhibits at the canteen and were on hand
to explain what a strong Digital Defence means.</p>
<p>As we have seen over the course of the pandemic, it is important that
Singapore remains strong and its populace resilient to withstand challenges
both local and global. The week’s CCE lesson highlighted initiatives pertaining
to food sustainability in Singapore, and it was inspiring to see Total
Defence in action for something so prosaic and which many arguably take
for granted.</p>
<p>To round off the week, a lockdown drill was conducted to strengthen our
school’s emergency preparedness and response. This served as an important
reminder of the part we all have to play in keeping the Regent community
and our loved ones safe.</p>

<h2><strong>NRIC Presentation Ceremony 2022</strong></h2>
<p>20 October 2022 was a special day for our Secondary Three students, who
received their NRICs from our Principal and their Form Teachers.</p>
<p>To kickstart the presentation ceremony, a lesson on citizenship was conducted
and our students learnt more about the significance of the NRIC and the
rights and privileges they enjoy as a Singapore citizen. Of course, with
these privileges come great responsibilities that one should uphold as
a citizen of the country. Our students then participated in an in-class
discussion where they thought about ways they could actively contribute
to our nation’s progress. Students pledged to do their part through small
actions like picking up litter to keep our country clean, serving National
Service, and shared their aspirations for making Singapore a better place
for all to live in. The ceremony rounded off with a photo-taking session
where our students proudly displayed their NRICs, now imbued with new meaning.
‘The NRIC is important in helping to identify Singaporeans. It is a significant
document that recognises one as a citizen or Permanent Resident of the
country. I am glad that I can finally identify myself as a true Singaporean,
not just with my passport, but also with this card. It gives me a sense
of belonging to the country, and I am very thankful for that,’ shared Siti
Nurul Aireen Binte Rozali (3-Respect).</p>
<p>For Tay Jin Yi (3-Empathy), the momentous occasion has helped shape her
understanding about what it means to have a sense of identity and belonging
to this place we call Home. ‘I am forever grateful to our founding fathers
and pioneers for all that they have done for our nation. Knowing this has
made me more motivated to contribute back to society as part of Singapore’s
future generation of leaders.’</p>
<p>Indeed, John F. Kennedy once said, ‘Ask not what your country can do for
you—ask what you can do for your country.’ It is our hope that our Regenites
grow to become responsible men and women who take great pride in defending
and shaping our nation through civic action and public service.</p>

<h2><strong>National Day Celebration 2022</strong></h2>
<p>Each time we sing the lines in the chorus of our National Anthem, “Majulah
Singapura”, we are filled with a strong sense of patriotism and hope for
Singapore. The theme for this year’s National Day, “Stronger Together,
Majulah” aptly brought out the spirit of the nation as we commemorated
the event on 8 August 2022. “Stronger Together” reminds Singaporeans that
unity in our diversity is what makes us stronger, whereas “majulah”, which
means “onward”, encapsulates our hopes and spirit as a nation since our
independence 57 years ago.</p>
<p>The day started off majestically at the parade square as the school gathered
for the Observance Ceremony. Our sharp-looking Uniformed Group cadets were
already in formation, representing the fortitude of Singapore. The Concert
Band alleviated our pride during the singing of national anthem as we sang
along to their live performance. As the students recited the “Recollections”
and chanted refrains like “We pledge to keep our nation free, with justice
and equality”, we solidified the pledge that the future is in our hands,
and we should not take our independence for granted. Our strong emotions
continued to soar as Show Choir led us in the singing of “My Nation, My
Home.”</p>
<p>During the national day lesson, students had a chance to reflect on their
experience of living through the pandemic and make a commitment on how
they could contribute to a future they envision for Singapore by submitting
their digital pledge. The future of Singapore is also dependent on our
international relationships and Singapore is one of the founding countries
of ASEAN. Since 8 August happened to be ASEAN Day, NE Ambassadors led their
classes in a Kahoot activity to remind students of the role ASEAN plays
for the nation.</p>
<p>In the last segment, the school gathered once again in the hall for the
concert item. We were greatly entertained with a live drama programme entitled,
“Pieces of You, Pieces of Me” by Interaction Arts and Drama Network. Through
the character, Sam, students were reminded of the critical role they play
in preserving our nation’s heritage and defending the nation.</p>
<p>To see our dreams come alive, the National Day edition of Regent Rave
gave us the chance to hear our students share their well-wishes for Singapore.
We were inspired to be stronger together and take actions for our beloved
country. Hence, it was momentous for the school to rejoice the culmination
of “Together Regent Care,” in which every member of Regent family contributed
goody bags for our partners in the community as well the support staff
in our school.</p>
<p>The day ended in a high note as we were once again serenaded by Regent
Pop Band who performed some of our favourite National Day melodies. Show
Choir students once again led the school in the singing of community songs
as we expressed our love and joy for Singapore.</p>
<p>All in all, Regent Secondary School would like to wish Singapore a Happy
57th birthday and we are proud and exhilarated to celebrate this significant
day with the nation!</p>

<h2><strong>Racial Harmony Day 2022</strong></h2>
<p>Regent came together to commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 21 July, and
it was a day where our students reflected on and celebrated Singapore as
a harmonious society built on a rich diversity of cultures.</p>
<p>‘Multicultural Mosaic’ is the theme for 2022, and it aptly reflects how
each community, while having the space to express its own identity, intertwines
with others to create the unique cultural diversity that characterises
Singapore life. To bring this theme alive, we had an inter-class competition
where our students drew beautiful mosaics that showcased the richness of
our culture with food, costumes, festivals, and traditional entertainment
galore!</p>
<p>The hall too was a sea of colours as our students gathered for the Racial
Harmony Day Concert. To mark the occasion, many donned traditional costumes
such as the baju kurung, cheongsam, and sari, and they took pride in explaining
the significance of their attire to their peers. The school was abuzz with
excitement as our lively student emcees took the stage and shared interesting
tidbits about the various festivals celebrated in Singapore. English Drama
also put up a meaningful performance about how our forefathers had to navigate
changes and learn to work with different groups to make Singapore a prosperous
place.</p>
<p>For student Lim Xin Tong (1-Empathy), the highlight of the concert was
seeing Regent Pop Band perform a medley of songs in Malay and Mandarin.
The performance served as a reminder that we can enjoy and appreciate music
and entertainment from many different cultures in Singapore.</p>
<p>Finally, our students continued discussing the issue of race during their
weekly CCE lessons, where they reflected on their personal experiences.
Newspaper articles were also used as a springboard to discuss contemporary
events pertaining to the topic.</p>
<p>Celebrating Racial Harmony Day 2022 was a poignant reminder that all of
us play a critical role in maintaining social cohesion in Singapore.</p>

<h2><strong>E-Internationalisation</strong></h2>
<p>Regent Secondary School had its first inaugural Internationalisation Programme
with students from Botany Downs Secondary College, Auckland, New Zealand
at the end of Semester 1 this year.</p>
<p>The Internationalisation Programme aims to equip Regenites with a global
perspective. With globalisation, students will need to possess multi-cultural
literacy and the use of technology which is becoming increasingly important.&nbsp;Bearing
the concept that “The World is my Classroom”, this international exposure
provides opportunities for students to engage in real-world application
of knowledge, skills and values which will be beneficial academically and
holistically.</p>
<p>After the opening addresses by our Principal, Mr Leong Kok Kee and Head
of Social Sciences of Botany Downs Secondary School College, Ms Karen Douglas,
the sharing commenced and students had the chance to interact with each
other and share about their country, their school life and environmental
sustainability.</p>
<h4><strong>From Regent Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>One of the students, Bryan Wong (3-Integrity) said, "It was good to meet
them ‘live’ on-screen and to share with them about our hawker culture and
interesting places in Singapore. We also introduced them to Regent Secondary
School. I hope that we will be able to interact further with Botany Secondary
School students in future and forge new friendships with them.”</p>
<p>Environmental Sciences CCA leaders, Joeie Neo (3G) and Grier Quah (3-Empathy),
shared, "I liked the sharing on environmental sustainability in Botany
Downs Secondary Collège and hope to implement some of their ideas in our
school. When I knew that I was selected to participate in the e-internalization
program, I had a mixed feelings of excitement and being nervous. Throughout
this e-internalization, I gained a better understanding of what New Zealand
schools are doing to protect the environment and observed how their lifestyles
are very different from ours.</p>
<p>Kar Yan (3 Empathy) noted, “The students were very friendly. Initially,
I was scared and nervous, but I overcame this when I realized that they
were students of the same age. They were open to sharing of their learning
experiences and I hope to meet them one day.”</p>
<h4><strong>From Botany Downs Secondary College</strong></h4>
<p>It was fun to see how they spend their mornings in Singapore. I liked
their uniforms because they were very classy and looked excellent. It was
fascinating learning about Singapore. Singapore looks like a great place
to live and learn. I now want to move there, they made it so appealing.
- Maddy</p>
<p>I really enjoyed listening to the entire presentation and meeting people
from a different part of the world. I learnt a lot about Singapore and
how they spend their mornings quite differently from ours. It gave me an
opportunity to compare how our life is in New Zealand to theirs in Singapore.
I particularly liked the uniform and the presentation about the different
types of foods you can get in street stalls and restaurants. I was quite
surprised but impressed with the ban on chewing gum and how people abided
to the rule. Overall, I think this was a really great opportunity to meet
new people from around the world and compare how different our lives are.
- Nyesa</p>
<p>I really liked learning all of the new information about Singapore and
their way of life. It was nice hearing about the culture and the food along
with the tourist attractions as well. Their school life was the most intriguing
to hear about since it was so starkly different from ours in New Zealand.
They have so many eco and environment programs and competitions in school.
Hearing about the mix of cultures and food was also quite nice since New
Zealand is also a mix of cultures and religions. Looking at the presentation
slides about food made me quite hungry since the pictures made the food
looked so delicious. Overall, it was a very entertaining session where
everyone learned something and enjoyed themselves. - Raunaq</p>
<p>In conclusion, as it was a first for us, we were very pleased to hear
positive comments from both schools. Though we were on a tight schedule,
it was a good start to allow our students to connect with students from
another side of the world. It was heartening to see the students expressing
interests in having another ZOOM meeting with their new friends, exchanging
emails and Instagram accounts to keep in touch and maintain this new friendship.</p>

<h2><strong>International Friendship Day 2022</strong></h2>
<p>Our Regenites commemorated International Friendship Day on 8 April, and
a myriad of activities was organized throughout the week for students to
understand the importance of good relations between friends and countries.</p>
<p>At the start of the week, our Principal set the context for Regenites
to understand how the conflict in Ukraine could affect Singapore and our
sovereignty. Students continued to delve deeper into the topic during CCE
lessons by discussing how the war had impacted the people of Ukraine as
well as how the international community has responded to the conflict.
This deepened our understanding of Singapore’s realities as a small state
and the importance of safeguarding our national interests. Students also
took part in an exciting inter-class competition, where they designed posters
to encapsulate their key takeaways from International Friendship Day.</p>
<p>In addition, students also had the chance to listen to how strong friendships
have been forged between Regenites of different nationalities. Our international
student, Kim Huiyeon (2-Gratitude) shared about her experience growing
up in Korea and how she has adapted to life in Singapore. Her Singaporean
classmate, Lee Xin Yan Richelle, shared how she and Huiyeon have strengthened
their friendship through common interests.</p>
<p>Our NE Ambassadors also led their classmates to facilitate an engaging
activity to learn more about the significance of international friendships.
Designed with the principles of Differentiated Instruction, students moved
around three Learning Stations set up in the classrooms to access various
interactive and rich texts. Students watched interesting videos, read insightful
articles from the special IN Edition, and took part in Kahoot quizzes.</p>
<p>Overall, our students had a blast learning about International Friendship
Day whilst promoting the spirit of friendship and collaboration. All of
us have an active role in fostering people-to-people ties and celebrate
the region's diversity and vibrancy!</p>

<h2><strong>Total Defence Day 2022</strong></h2>
<p>Total Defence is the cornerstone of Singapore’s deterrent strategy, and
is crucial to the continued security, survival, and success of the country.</p>
<p>This year, we commemorated Total Defence Day with a slew of activities
throughout the week, beginning with a parade by our Uniformed Groups on
Tuesday, 15 Feb. It was heartening to see our Boys’ Brigade, Girls’ Brigade,
National Police Cadet Corps, and Red Cross Youth cadets come together as
one for this momentous occasion.</p>
<p>Our weekly CCE lessons also continued to reinforce the need for us to
play our part to protect ourselves against hybrid threats. In keeping with
this year’s theme, ‘Together We Keep Singapore Strong’, our students created
artefacts to pledge the small ways they could help put Total Defence into
action in their daily lives. They also joined our Cyber-Wellness Ambassadors
at an interactive booth in the canteen where they learnt more about digital
defence and even participated in a quiz to win wonderful prizes!</p>
<p>On 17 February, our series of commemorative events concluded with a special
programme helmed by the Uniformed Groups. Our enthusiastic UG cadets stepped
into every class to promote awareness of and participation in the 6 pillars
of Total Defence. Students learnt new skills such as Basic First Aid and
familiarised themselves with the Public Warning System as well as the game,
‘Guardians of the City’.</p>
<p>Overall, we had a memorable TDD which enhanced our four key citizenship
dispositions: a sense of belonging, a sense of reality, a sense of hope,
and the will to act.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Together, we keep Singapore strong!</p>

<p>23 September 2021 was a momentous occasion for our Secondary Three students,
who received their National Registration Identity Cards (NRIC)!</p>
<p>They learnt more about the significance of the NRIC as a symbol of citizenship
and were engaged in a fun activity to check the formula behind their T-series
NRIC numbers. We hope today's event has inspired our Secondary Three students
in their journey as youths of Singapore!</p>
<hr>
<h2><strong>NRIC Registration</strong></h2>
<p>On 29 June 2021, our 15-year-old students registered for their NRIC in
school for the first time.</p>
<p>It is an important milestone for our students as it represents a day they
become more aware of their citizenship as well as the rights and responsibilities
that come with being a Singapore citizen.</p>
<p>With safe management measures in place, the exercise was carried out in
an efficient and orderly manner. Thank you to our school’s support staff
for making this exercise run smoothly!</p>

<h2><strong>Total Defence Day 2021</strong></h2>
<p>Over the course of the past two weeks, Regent Secondary School commemorated
Total Defence Day 2021. Some of the activities that our students were involved
in include a pop-up display showing the Total Defence Puzzle, which showcases
the many items that the public can do to put Total Defence in action. Our
Uniformed Groups cadets also came into action, conducting lessons which
imbue skills and knowledge such as First Aid to the whole school, as well
as putting up a parade to demonstrate their commitment to Total Defence.
Students in school were also involved in the “Find the Suspicious Package”
Activity, which aimed to hone students’ vigilance in looking out for dubious
items which looked out of place. To cap off the whole series of activities,
the school invited several veteran SAF soldiers and NSmen to share their
experiences with the school via Zoom. These engaging speakers took the
opportunity to impart valuable lessons about how Total Defence can aid
Singapore in its fight against Covid-19, as well as how National Service
serves as a strong pillar of defence for Singapore. Overall, these whole
suite of activities served to educate our students about Total Defence,
and how “Together, we keep Singapore strong!”</p>

<p>In the month of April, we celebrated International Friendship Day (IFD)
at Regent Secondary School! The theme for this year’s IFD is "Singapore
in the World". From 5th to 9th April, students took part in various activities
such as learning about Singapore's relations with countries around us during
our morning assembly programme as well as understanding more about COVAX
and Singapore’s contributions to the world during CCE lessons.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Information sheets about COVAX created by Upper Sec students</em>

<p></p>
<p>Our Upper Secondary students have also prepared information sheets to
educate their juniors about COVAX. Through this CCE-IFD lesson, students
are more aware of the need for countries to offer practical help in ensuring
the world is a safer place for all humanity.</p>
<p>Our NE Ambassadors have also been hard at work. On International Friendship
Day, our ambassadors led their classmates in completing a Crossword Puzzle
as well as a Venn diagram to build on students’ understanding about the
different countries around us.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/National%20Education/IFD2021-4.jpg">
</div>
<p>We also had some of our foreign students from Vietnam, Malaysia and India
take to the screen to share about what life was like back in their home
country in terms of food, pastimes, festivals and education system. Through
these activities, students got to learn about the countries around Singapore,
and realized that beneath the differences we are all very much alike. Finally,
we capped off the day by having all staff and students wear yellow to school
to commemorate the importance of Singapore developing friendships both
within ASEAN as well as with the other countries around the world.</p>

<h2><strong>Racial Harmony Day 2021</strong></h2>
<p>Our teachers and students donned colourful ethnic costumes to commemorate
this special day which marked the importance of maintaining racial and
religious harmony in Singapore’s multi-ethnic and multicultural society.
With this year’s Racial Harmony Day theme being ‘Common Spaces, Connected
Communities’, our group of teachers from the National Education Committee
planned meaningful activities to encourage our students to understand the
importance of common spaces in Singapore and how such spaces foster cohesion
and harmony. A key highlight was the rich discussion in each class about
their positive experiences with different ethnic groups. Students had fun
sharing their memorable moments with their classmates, while maintaining
safe distancing.</p>
