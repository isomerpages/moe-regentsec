<h2><strong>Racial Harmony Day 2025</strong></h2>
<h4>Celebrating Diversity: Racial Harmony Day Concert 2025 – Our People, Our Tapestry</h4>
<p>On 22 July 2025, Regent Secondary School came alive with vibrant performances,
heartfelt stories, and the united spirit of our multicultural community
as we celebrated Racial Harmony Day. This year’s theme, “Our People, Our
Tapestry”, shone a spotlight on how Singapore’s diverse cultural threads
are beautifully woven together to form our shared national identity.</p>
<p>The celebration began with the Culture Uncovered segment, where students
and teachers shared personal insights on their cultural backgrounds. These
reflections highlighted how different beliefs can share common values such
as empathy, discipline, and strong family ties.</p>
<p>A particularly memorable moment was a live Pipa performance of <em>Lan Ting Xu</em> by
Jay Chou, performed by Hanning from 1 Gratitude. Her skill and artistry
offered a beautiful glimpse into musical heritage and left the audience
captivated.</p>

<p>Students began the week with the IFD Regent Rave and in-class engagement
sessions. International students and NE Ambassadors took the lead, sharing
their personal stories and insights on cultural diversity, sparking conversations
about cross-cultural understanding.</p>
<p>Building on these meaningful exchanges, students were next treated to
a musical celebration of cultural unity through a live performance by a
4-piece band from Hummingbird Music. The band played iconic songs from
across ASEAN, including Getaran Jiwa (Malaysia), Sabaaai Sabaaai (Thailand),
Khong (Vietnam), and Anak (Philippines). The captivating performances gave
students a chance to see how music transcends borders and fosters cultural
appreciation. As one student, Zhi Le, shared, the commemorative events
reinforced “how essential it is to create an inclusive, respectful environment.”</p>

<p>The week concluded with CCE lessons focused on the theme of openness.
Lower Secondary students explored openness through gallery walks and reflected
on its meaning at personal, community, and national levels. Meanwhile,
Upper Secondary students used a four-point compass framework to examine
the value of staying open-minded in a changing world.</p>
<p>Across the week, students embraced the opportunity to celebrate the diverse
backgrounds that make up the Regent community. The events left a lasting
impression, reminding us that even small acts of openness and understanding
can help forge strong friendships in a complex world.</p>
