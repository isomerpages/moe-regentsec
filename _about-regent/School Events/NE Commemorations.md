### **Total Defence Day**

Over the course of the past two weeks, Regent Secondary School commemorated Total Defence Day 2021. Some of the activities that our students were involved in include a pop-up display showing the Total Defence Puzzle, which showcases the many items that the public can do to put Total Defence in action. Our Uniformed Groups cadets also came into action, conducting lessons which imbue skills and knowledge such as First Aid to the whole school, as well as putting up a parade to demonstrate their commitment to Total Defence. Students in school were also involved in the “Find the Suspicious Package” Activity, which aimed to hone students’ vigilance in looking out for dubious items which looked out of place. To cap off the whole series of activities, the school invited several veteran SAF soldiers and NSmen to share their experiences with the school via Zoom. These engaging speakers took the opportunity to impart valuable lessons about how Total Defence can aid Singapore in its fight against Covid-19, as well as how National Service serves as a strong pillar of defence for Singapore. Overall, these whole suite of activities served to educate our students about Total Defence, and how “together, we keep Singapore strong!”

### **International Friendship Day**

In the month of April, we celebrated International Friendship Day (IFD) at Regent Secondary School! The theme for this year’s IFD is “Singapore in the World”. From 5th to 9th April, students took part in various activities such as learning about Singapore’s relations with countries around us during our morning assembly programme as well as understanding more about COVAX and Singapore’s contributions to the world during CCE lessons. Our Upper Secondary students have also prepared information sheets to educate their juniors about COVAX. Through this CCE-IFD lesson, students are more aware of the need for countries to offer practical help in ensuring the world is a safer place for all humanity.

Our NE Ambassadors have also been hard at work. On International Friendship Day, our ambassadors led their classmates in completing a Crossword Puzzle as well as a Venn diagram to build on students’ understanding about the different countries around us. We also had some of our foreign students from Vietnam, Malaysia and India take to the screen to share about what life was like back in their home country in terms of food, pastimes, festivals and education system. Through these activities, students got to learn about the countries around Singapore, and realized that beneath the differences we are all very much alike. Finally, we capped off the day by having all staff and students wear yellow to school to commemorate the importance of Singapore developing friendships both within ASEAN as well as with the other countries around the world.
