### **Total Defence Day**

Over the course of the past two weeks, Regent Secondary School commemorated Total Defence Day 2021. Some of the activities that our students were involved in include a pop-up display showing the Total Defence Puzzle, which showcases the many items that the public can do to put Total Defence in action. Our Uniformed Groups cadets also came into action, conducting lessons which imbue skills and knowledge such as First Aid to the whole school, as well as putting up a parade to demonstrate their commitment to Total Defence. Students in school were also involved in the “Find the Suspicious Package” Activity, which aimed to hone students’ vigilance in looking out for dubious items which looked out of place. To cap off the whole series of activities, the school invited several veteran SAF soldiers and NSmen to share their experiences with the school via Zoom. These engaging speakers took the opportunity to impart valuable lessons about how Total Defence can aid Singapore in its fight against Covid-19, as well as how National Service serves as a strong pillar of defence for Singapore. Overall, these whole suite of activities served to educate our students about Total Defence, and how “together, we keep Singapore strong!”
