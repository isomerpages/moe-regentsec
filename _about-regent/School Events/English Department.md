<p>Regent Secondary School has proudly entered the Singapore Book of Records
for achieving the “Most Number of Students Contributing to a Storybook
at One Location.” This remarkable feat was made possible through the dedication
of our students and teachers in the English Language and Literature Department.</p>

<p>Over the course of one month, 20 classes from Secondary 1 to 3 came together
to craft a collective story. Each class contributed a unique chapter, culminating
in a 20-chapter narrative that showcased the imagination, creativity and
teamwork of Regenites.</p>
<p>At the heart of the book lies a mysterious mirror in the school library
that reveals hidden perspectives of three main characters. Guided by Jamie
and Priya- 2 of the main characters, the story explores how students learn
to see the impact of their actions, discover compassion and foster inclusivity.
Along the way, Jamie starts an Art club — a safe haven for creative expression
and healing — inspiring the school community to come together in empathy
and creativity.</p>

<p>This achievement goes beyond recognition in the Singapore Book of Records.
It embodies the spirit of learning at Regent Secondary, where students
are encouraged to collaborate, reflect and grow through meaningful experiences.
Teachers played a pivotal role in guiding the process, but it was the energy
and ideas of our Regenites that truly brought the story to life.</p>

<p>This milestone would not have been possible without the hard work of both
teachers and students. As Helen Keller once said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this project.
Let us continue to Blaze Forth to Glory!</p>

<h2><strong>Bringing Literature to Life: Inspiring Learning Journeys Through Theatre</strong></h2>
<p>The English and Literature Department at Regent Secondary School recently
organised two enriching learning journeys that brought literature beyond
the classroom and onto the stage, offering students immersive, real-world
experiences of the texts they study.</p>
<p><strong>A Magical Evening with <em>Wicked</em></strong>
</p>
<p>On 11 April 2025, our Secondary 4 Elective Literature students attended
the spellbinding performance of <em>Wicked</em> at the Sands Theatre. This
school enrichment programme aimed to deepen students’ literary appreciation
through live theatre. From the actors’ emotive portrayals to the intricate
set design and compelling storytelling, students were captivated by the
magical retelling of the Land of Oz. The experience offered fresh perspectives
on character development, themes, and dramatic techniques—making literature
not just studied, but truly felt.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing Texts Alive for Lower Secondary</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Secondary 2 Literature students enjoyed an equally impactful experience
on 20 May 2025. A cohort of 40 students attended a live staging of <em>Perfecting Pratas</em> and <em>Don’t Know Don’t Care</em>—two
plays featured in their literature syllabus. Seeing the characters and
conflicts brought to life on stage deepened their comprehension and engagement.
Students gained a more nuanced understanding of plot and themes, while
the actors’ interpretations added emotional and visual dimensions that
enriched classroom learning. For many, it made the literature more relatable
and memorable.</p>
<p><strong>Lasting Impressions and Lifelong Appreciation</strong>
</p>
<p>These learning journeys not only strengthened students’ analytical skills
but also sparked thoughtful conversations about human relationships, societal
issues, and personal identity as reflected in the plays. By watching literature
unfold live, students experienced firsthand the transformative power of
the performing arts.</p>
<p>Such initiatives affirm our commitment to nurturing thoughtful, empathetic,
and culturally engaged learners—one performance at a time.</p>
