<h2><strong>Literature Enrichment - Matilda</strong></h2>
<p>On 6 April 2024, our Secondary Two Regenites had a captivating time at
the Sands Theatre watching the Royal Shakespeare Company’s ‘Matilda’—an
award-winning musical adapted from Ronald’s Dahl famous novel. Matilda
explores the story of an extraordinary little girl who, armed with a vivid
imagination and keen intellect, stepped up to change her own destiny and
better the lives of others around her.</p>
<p>From the moment the curtains rose, our students were swept away by the
play’s energetic choreography and catchy melodies. Coupled with the intricate
stage designs, the tapestry of colours and movement captured the hearts
of our students as they sang confidently to the lyrics of famous songs
like “When I Grow Up”.</p>
<p>Student Asleigh Chua (S2-Respect) remarked, “I really enjoyed the ending
of the musical when Miss Honey emerged victorious against Miss Trunchbull,
reclaiming what had rightfully belonged to her. This made me feel a sense
of justice and happiness for Miss Honey. I realised that no matter how
bleak circumstances may seem, as long as one remains optimistic and never
gives up, things will change for the better.”</p>
<p>Similar sentiments were shared by Chua Oo Heng Marcus (S2-Empathy). “Everything
was so exciting, and I was so engrossed in the play that I lost track of
time! I had fun noticing how the stage directions added to the play’s mood
and atmosphere—how Matilda’s classmates became increasingly sluggish and
tired the more domineering Miss Trunchbull became, and how the music and
sound effects made her person sound louder and more intimidating. But when
Matilda stood up for her classmates, the mood onstage quickly shifted from
apprehension to rambunctious joy. Overall, watching the musical made for
a thoroughly exhilarating experience.”</p>
<p>Journeying with Matilda has allowed our students to understand the importance
of staying optimistic, having resilience, and embracing one’s unique identity.
Our students also came away with a greater appreciation for drama in Literature
as they saw how beloved characters were transformed from page to stage!
We are certain that this magical experience will linger long in the memories
of Regenites long after the curtain calls.</p>

<h2><strong>Literature Enrichment Programme</strong></h2>
<p>In March, our Secondary Three Literature students made a trip to the theatre
as part of the Literature Enrichment Programme. They watched Pangdemonium’s
production of Falling, now back for its second run after the success of
its initial staging in 2016. Written by American playwright Deanna Jent,
Falling explores family life in a household with a severely autistic child
and sheds light on the everyday challenges caregivers of persons with special
needs face.</p>
<p>By turns gripping and darkly humorous, the heartrending play had our students
on the edge of their seats, riveted by the stories of its characters and
the many poignant moments. The play, coupled with a post-show dialogue
with members of the autistic community in Singapore, left a deep impression
on our students. Many came away from the experience a little more thoughtful
and aware about the kinds of ableism that exist in society and attuned
to the themes of difference and unconditional love as exemplified in our
Literature set text, The Chrysalids. It was certainly an afternoon our
students would never forget.</p>

<h2><strong>Secondary Two Literature Enrichment Programme – The LKY Musical</strong></h2>
<p>Literature came alive for our Secondary Two students who attended Singapore
Repertory Theatre’s production of The LKY Musical on 21 September 2022.
Now in its second run, the blockbuster show tells the story of Singapore’s
first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, and charts his journey from student
to politician fighting for Singapore’s independence.</p>
<p>There were gasps of awe and delight as our students entered the Sands
Theatre and took in the elaborate sets. They were riveted by the cast’s
impeccable acting and singing and marveled at how music by the live orchestra
helped add to the play’s emotional impact. For many of our students, it
was their first time watching a play, and the experience certainly imbued
them with a greater appreciation of the drama texts that they have been
studying in the Literature classroom. Likewise, it was fascinating to hear
the stories of individuals significant to our nation’s history and to encounter
them beyond the pages of our History textbooks.</p>
<p>The trip to the theatre was undoubtedly a rich learning experience for
our Regenites, and we look forward to the next!</p>

<h2><strong>Literature Enrichment Programme – Into the Woods</strong></h2>
<p>Last Saturday, our Secondary Two students spent an enchanting afternoon
at the Singtel Waterfront Theatre, where they enjoyed Pangdemonium’s production
of the award-winning musical, Into the Woods.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Featuring showtunes by theatre great Stephen Sondheim, the musical intertwines
the plots of several fairy tales, and our students were delighted to see
well-loved characters from the likes of “Cinderella”, “Jack and the Beanstalk”,
and “Little Red Riding Hood” take the stage! They were riveted by the cast’s
impeccable acting and singing, as well as the play’s elaborate sets that
helped add to its emotional impact. There were moments of levity too, with
the musical putting a fresh spin on these beloved fairy tales and having
characters break the fourth wall.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The trip to the theatre was undoubtedly a rich learning experience for
our students, imbuing them with a greater appreciation of the drama texts
that they have been studying in the Literature classroom. A feast for the
eyes and ears, the musical was, in all, a wonderful way to round off the
school year!</p>
