<h4>Graduating Cohort Wraps Up with a Spirited Sports Fiesta!</h4>
<p>On the 4<sup>th</sup> of July, our graduating cohort came together for
an exhilarating Sports Fiesta: Ultimate Frisbee Tournamentâ€”a well-deserved
breather before they dive into their final preparations for the national
examinations.</p>

<p>The inter-class tournament was more than just a fun-filled event. It was
a lively celebration of teamwork, skill, and determination as students
took to the field with great enthusiasm. Each class strategised, communicated,
and played their hearts out, applying the Ultimate Frisbee techniques they
had learnt during PE lessons. The matches were packed with fast-paced action,
from sharp passes and quick sprints to well-timed catches that drew cheers
from their classmates. Beyond the competition, the tournament fostered
camaraderie and unity, with students encouraging one another and celebrating
every moment together. It was a meaningful way for the cohort to bond one
last time before shifting their focus fully to their national exams.</p>

whose efforts in planning and organising the event made it a seamless and
enjoyable experience for everyone.</p>

<h4>A Run to Remember: Regent Secondary Schoolâ€™s Cross Country 2025</h4>
<p>On the cool morning of Friday, 23 May 2025, over a thousand students and
staff gathered in the school hall, buzzing with anticipation for Regent
Secondary Schoolâ€™s Annual Cross Country Run. The 3.6km route would see
the participants making a loop around the Pang Sua Park Connector. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the early hour, energy crackled in the atmosphere. Students in
brightly coloured class T-shirts clustered in groups, warming up with stretches
and nervous laughter. This yearâ€™s edition of the race featured a revamped
Competitive Race category. Students had to meet the qualifying time of
at least a C-Grade for their respective age-groups in the NAPFA Test 2.4km
run to make the cut as competitive runners. This made for a tightly-contested
race as the runners aimed for a Top 20 and possibly even a podium finish!</p>

<p>Teachers marshalled the excited participants towards the starting line
and when the starting horn was blasted, the runners surged forward like
a wave, weaving down the gravel track and leaving a cloud of fine dust
in their wake. The route challenged runners with gentle slopes and muddy
patches, but the cool weather was a welcome companion, keeping spirits
high. Along the way, students and teachers in the Fun Run category mingled
and encouraged one another as they brisk-walked and jogged along the park
connector.</p>

<p>For some, it was a serious race for glory; for others, a joyful jog among
friends. As the finish line drew near, cheers erupted for every runner
crossing itâ€”regardless of speed.</p>
<p>More than just a race, the event was a celebration of perseverance, school
spirit, and community, leaving everyone eagerly awaiting next yearâ€™s run.</p>
