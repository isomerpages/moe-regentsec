<h2><strong>Sports Fiesta: Post-Exam Activity</strong></h2>
<p>The much-anticipated Sports Fiesta was the perfect way to end the school
year before the holiday break. After weeks of hard work and the stress
of the final examinations, our Secondary 1 to 3 students were eager to
take to the field for some friendly competition and what an exciting event
it was!</p>

<p>Held on 23 and 25 October, the Sports Fiesta saw our Secondary 1 to 3
students competing in a range of exciting sportsâ€”Football, Netball, and
Volleyballâ€”each tailored to their respective levels. The energy was palpable
as students showcased their athletic skills, applying all they had learned
during their PE lessons in a competitive setting. But the fun didnâ€™t stop
at the games. Alongside the thrilling matches, a variety of carnival arcade
machines were set up to add an extra ounce of excitement and joy to the
day. It was a perfect blend of competition and fun, offering something
for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>A big shoutout to the Regent PE Department and all our CCA leaders for
their hard work and dedication in organising this spectacular event. Without
their efforts, the Sports Fiesta would not have been such a resounding
success! It was a fantastic way to wrap up the year.</p>

<h2><strong>Secondary 4 &amp; 5 Sports Fiesta - Ultimate Frisbee</strong></h2>
<p>On 28 June 2024, under skies that alternated between downpours and glimpses
of the sun, our graduating cohort gathered for the annual Sports Fiesta,
an exhilarating Ultimate Frisbee showdown that pitted our Secondary Four
and Five classes against one another in a display of skill and sportsmanship.
Despite the weatherâ€™s unpredictability, the enthusiasm on the field was
palpable, with students eagerly putting the skills learnt in PE lessons
to the test.</p>
<p>Class 4-Integrity emerged as the undeniable champions of the day, their
teamwork and strategic plays securing them the coveted title of Overall
Class Champion. Ong Kai Ler from 4-Integrity and Jacqueline Lee from 4-Determiation
were also recognised for their outstanding sportsmanship during the tournament,&nbsp;
and were awarded the Best Sports Boy and Best Sports Girl trophies respectively
amidst cheers and applause from their peers.</p>
<p>The success of the tournament would not have been possible without the
meticulous planning and dedication of the PE department and our Secondary
Three CCA leaders. Their efforts ensured a seamlessly-organised event where
every pass, catch, and goal contributed to a memorable experience for all
participants.</p>
<p>As our Secondary Four and Five students now turn their focus to the upcoming
national examinations, their performance at the Sports Fiesta serves as
a testament to their resilience and commitment, both on and off the field.
They not only showcased their athletic abilities but also demonstrated
the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and fair play.</p>

<h2><strong>Annual Cross-Country Run</strong></h2>
<p>The Cross Country Run, held on 17 May 2024, was the first mass-participation
sports event of the year for our students, and it was nothing short of
electrifying. With students primed and pumped for the runâ€”many with aspirations
of clinching a highly-coveted top-20 position in the Upper and Lower Secondary
Boys and Girls race categoriesâ€”the atmosphere crackled with anticipation.
Adding to the excitement was the fact that Challenge Shields would be awarded
to the top class of each level, and this fuelled the fervour amongst runners
to help propel their class to glorious victory.</p>

<p>The week leading up to race day had been rainy and wet, and we were all
wishing for clear skies and our wishes were granted. As the golden rays
of sunlight broke through the clouds, wave after wave of eager runners
made their way from the school hall to converge at the starting line along
the Pang Sua Park Connector. Anticipation hung palpably in the air as runners
edged closer, poised for the momentous blast of the airhorn signalling
the commencement of the race. And then, they were off!</p>
<p>The 3.6km route took runners across different types of terrain, from gravel
paths to dirt tracks and onto the concrete pavements of the park connector.
While our competitive runners jostled and gunned for the top spot in their
respective race categories, camaraderie reigned supreme amongst our fun-runners
who walked and jogged alongside their friends and teachers. Even superheroes
Iron Man and Captain America momentarily set aside their world-saving duties
to join in the exhilarating run, underscoring the rare opportunity it was
for everyone to be out-of-doors that day, basking in the sun and the crisp
morning air.</p>

<p>For some, the run was about creating new memories with friends and classmates.
For others, it was about pushing themselves to the limit and attaining
new milestones. Regardless of their individual motivations, it is safe
to say that our Regenites were all runners and winners that day. For in
the realm of running, every stride embodies victory; every participant,
a winner. Whether one sprints at lightning speed or opts for a more leisurely
pace, whether a novice embarking on their inaugural race or a seasoned
marathoner, the essence of triumph lies not merely in finishing the race,
but in having the courage to start.</p>
<p>If there is one message to glean from the dayâ€™s exhilarating events, it
is this:</p>
<h4>â€˜When your legs get tired, run with your heart!â€™</h4>
