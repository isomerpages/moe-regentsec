<h2><strong>Sports Fiesta: Post-Exam Activity</strong></h2>
<p>The much-anticipated Sports Fiesta was the perfect way to end the school
year before the holiday break. After weeks of hard work and the stress
of the final examinations, our Secondary 1 to 3 students were eager to
take to the field for some friendly competition and what an exciting event
it was!</p>

<p>Held on 23 and 25 October, the Sports Fiesta saw our Secondary 1 to 3
students competing in a range of exciting sportsâ€”Football, Netball, and
Volleyballâ€”each tailored to their respective levels. The energy was palpable
as students showcased their athletic skills, applying all they had learned
during their PE lessons in a competitive setting. But the fun didnâ€™t stop
at the games. Alongside the thrilling matches, a variety of carnival arcade
machines were set up to add an extra ounce of excitement and joy to the
day. It was a perfect blend of competition and fun, offering something
for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>A big shoutout to the Regent PE Department and all our CCA leaders for
their hard work and dedication in organising this spectacular event. Without
their efforts, the Sports Fiesta would not have been such a resounding
success! It was a fantastic way to wrap up the year.</p>
