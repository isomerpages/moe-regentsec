<h2><strong>Secondary 4 &amp; 5 Sports Fiesta - Ultimate Frisbee</strong></h2>
<p>On 28 June 2024, under skies that alternated between downpours and glimpses
of the sun, our graduating cohort gathered for the annual Sports Fiesta,
an exhilarating Ultimate Frisbee showdown that pitted our Secondary Four
and Five classes against one another in a display of skill and sportsmanship.
Despite the weather’s unpredictability, the enthusiasm on the field was
palpable, with students eagerly putting the skills learnt in PE lessons
to the test.</p>
<p>Class 4-Integrity emerged as the undeniable champions of the day, their
teamwork and strategic plays securing them the coveted title of Overall
Class Champion. Ong Kai Ler from 4-Integrity and Jacqueline Lee from 4-Determiation
were also recognised for their outstanding sportsmanship during the tournament,&nbsp;
and were awarded the Best Sports Boy and Best Sports Girl trophies respectively
amidst cheers and applause from their peers.</p>
<p>The success of the tournament would not have been possible without the
meticulous planning and dedication of the PE department and our Secondary
Three CCA leaders. Their efforts ensured a seamlessly-organised event where
every pass, catch, and goal contributed to a memorable experience for all
participants.</p>
<p>As our Secondary Four and Five students now turn their focus to the upcoming
national examinations, their performance at the Sports Fiesta serves as
a testament to their resilience and commitment, both on and off the field.
They not only showcased their athletic abilities but also demonstrated
the importance of teamwork, perseverance, and fair play.</p>

<h2><strong>Annual Cross-Country Run</strong></h2>
<p>The Cross Country Run, held on 17 May 2024, was the first mass-participation
sports event of the year for our students, and it was nothing short of
electrifying. With students primed and pumped for the run—many with aspirations
of clinching a highly-coveted top-20 position in the Upper and Lower Secondary
Boys and Girls race categories—the atmosphere crackled with anticipation.
Adding to the excitement was the fact that Challenge Shields would be awarded
to the top class of each level, and this fuelled the fervour amongst runners
to help propel their class to glorious victory.</p>

<p>The week leading up to race day had been rainy and wet, and we were all
wishing for clear skies and our wishes were granted. As the golden rays
of sunlight broke through the clouds, wave after wave of eager runners
made their way from the school hall to converge at the starting line along
the Pang Sua Park Connector. Anticipation hung palpably in the air as runners
edged closer, poised for the momentous blast of the airhorn signalling
the commencement of the race. And then, they were off!</p>
<p>The 3.6km route took runners across different types of terrain, from gravel
paths to dirt tracks and onto the concrete pavements of the park connector.
While our competitive runners jostled and gunned for the top spot in their
respective race categories, camaraderie reigned supreme amongst our fun-runners
who walked and jogged alongside their friends and teachers. Even superheroes
Iron Man and Captain America momentarily set aside their world-saving duties
to join in the exhilarating run, underscoring the rare opportunity it was
for everyone to be out-of-doors that day, basking in the sun and the crisp
morning air.</p>

<p>For some, the run was about creating new memories with friends and classmates.
For others, it was about pushing themselves to the limit and attaining
new milestones. Regardless of their individual motivations, it is safe
to say that our Regenites were all runners and winners that day. For in
the realm of running, every stride embodies victory; every participant,
a winner. Whether one sprints at lightning speed or opts for a more leisurely
pace, whether a novice embarking on their inaugural race or a seasoned
marathoner, the essence of triumph lies not merely in finishing the race,
but in having the courage to start.</p>
<p>If there is one message to glean from the day’s exhilarating events, it
is this:</p>

<p>Our graduating cohort had their Sports Fiesta (Ultimate Frisbee) tournament

examinations. Through this inter-class tournament, students had the opportunity
to apply the Ultimate skills that they have learnt during the PE lessons.
4-Pride was awarded the Overall Class Champion. Qaysh Matin from 4-Determination
and Yuki Khoo from 4-Empathy both won the Best Sportsmanship awards.</p>

<p>When Your Legs Get Tired, Run With Your Heart</p>
<p>After a three-year hiatus, our annual Cross-Country Run made a triumphant
return this morning! The early morning rain threatened to put a stop to
the race even before it started but our fears were short-lived as the skies
cleared and the rays of golden sunlight broke through the clouds. Wave
after wave of eager runners made their way from the school hall, across
the field and to the starting line at the Pang Sua Park Connector. There
was an air of anticipation as the runners inched closer and closer to the
starting line, awaiting the blast of the airhorn that signaled the start
of the race…and off they went!</p>
<p>The 3.5km route took the runners through different terrain, from gravel,
to dirt and onto the Pang Sua Park Connector. While the competitive runners
jostled and challenged for the top positions in their respective categories,
the fun-runners walked and jogged alongside their friends, teachers and
even our Principal and Vice-Principals! It was a rare opportunity for everyone
to be outdoors and enjoying the fresh morning air for a change!</p>
<p>For some of us, it was about creating memories with friends and classmates;
for others, it was about pushing themselves to their physical limits and
achieving their personal bests. Regardless of our motivation, we are all
runners and winners today…if you run, you are already a winner. It does
not matter how fast you are or how long you run. It does not matter if
today is your first attempt at running 3.5km or if you have been running
much longer distances. The glory is not in finishing the race but in having
the courage to start.</p>
<p>If there is one takeaway from today, it is ‘When your legs get tired,
run with your heart’!</p>

<h2><strong>Virtual Run 2022</strong></h2>
<h4><em>“When your legs get tired, run with your heart.”</em></h4>
<p>This was the slogan for the highly anticipated Regent Virtual Run 2022.
Similar to last year’s edition, our staff and students worked hard to clock
their miles for the period of 14 March to 1 April, making good use of their
time to run or walk. Exciting awards for the Best Individual and Best Class
were up for grabs too!</p>
<p>Through the event, Regenites were able to spend more time with their families
and friends, exploring various places in Singapore on foot while clocking
their runs. Together, our Regenites did an amazing job during the virtual
run, and lived out the slogan by staying the course to clock a whopping
total of 10,000 km!</p>
<p>An awards ceremony was conducted on 14 April to recognise the spirited
efforts of all. These included the top 10 boys and girls for each level
and the top 3 staff (male/female). We are pleased to announce that 1-Integrity,
2-Empathy, 3-Integrity, and 4-Empathy clinched the Best Class awards for
their levels! Kudos too to our Taekwondo team, which has been awarded “Best
CCA”!</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our award winners, and we hope to see all Regenites
continue to stay active and healthy!</p>

<p>In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Regent PE department has organized a
virtual run instead of a live event for this year’s Cross Country. Thus,
Regent’s Journey Around Singapore Challenge was created!</p>
<p>The challenge for every class is to clock 193km as a class (FYI: The total
distance of Singapore’s coastline is 193km!). Students were able to compete
with one another through a live leaderboard as well! Students were encouraged
to stay active and fit during the pandemic and to run together with their
family members as a form of family bonding.</p>
<p>During the two weeks of the challenge, students are to clock their distance
using a distance tracking application on his smart phones. Students will
then upload their distance clocked during the run and a screenshot of the
route that they ran. The upload was seamless and the instructions were
easy to follow! Students can keep track of the total distance that they
have clocked via the live leaderboard available on the website.</p>
<p>At the end of the challenge, awards are given out to the top 10 male and
female students of each level. Awards for best class per level and top
3 staff members were given as well. Overall, our students and staff are
enjoyed their runs and explored new places at the same time. Let’s stay
healthy during this period of time and we hope this challenge has motivated
everyone to continue to stay active and fit!</p>
