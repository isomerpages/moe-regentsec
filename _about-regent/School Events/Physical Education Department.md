<h2><strong>Sec 4 &amp; 5 Sports Fiesta</strong></h2><h4>Sec 4 &amp; 5 Sports Fiesta (Ultimate Frisbee)</h4><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/Sec4-5SportsFiesta-1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/Sec4-5SportsFiesta-2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/Sec4-5SportsFiesta-3.jpg"></div><p>Our graduating cohort had their Sports Fiesta (Ultimate Frisbee) tournament on 30 June 2023 before they swing into full preparation for their national examinations.

The early morning rain threatened to put a stop to the race even before it started but our fears were short-lived as the skies cleared and the rays of golden sunlight broke through the clouds. Wave after wave of eager runners made their way from the school hall, across the field and to the starting line at the Pang Sua Park Connector. There was an air of anticipation as the runners inched closer and closer to the starting line, awaiting the blast of the airhorn that signaled the start of the race…and off they went!</p><p>The 3.5km route took the runners through different terrain, from gravel, to dirt and onto the Pang Sua Park Connector. While the competitive runners jostled and challenged for the top positions in their respective categories, the fun-runners walked and jogged alongside their friends, teachers and even our Principal and Vice-Principals! It was a rare opportunity for everyone to be outdoors and enjoying the fresh morning air for a change!</p><p>For some of us, it was about creating memories with friends and classmates; for others, it was about pushing themselves to their physical limits and achieving their personal bests. Regardless of our motivation, we are all runners and winners today…if you run, you are already a winner. It does not matter how fast you are or how long you run. It does not matter if today is your first attempt at running 3.5km or if you have been running much longer distances. The glory is not in finishing the race but in having the courage to start.</p><p>If there is one takeaway from today, it is ‘When your legs get tired, run with your heart’!</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-3.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-4.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-5.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-6.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-7.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-8.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-9.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-10.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-11.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-12.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-13.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-14.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Highlights%20Post/CrossCountry2023-15.jpg"></div><hr><h2><strong>Sec 4 &amp; 5 Sports Carnival 2022</strong></h2><h4>Sec 4 &amp; 5 Sports Carnival (Ultimate Frisbee)</h4><p>The long anticipated Sec 4 &amp; 5 Sports Carnival finally took place on 20 May!

Similar to last year’s edition, our staff and students worked hard to clock their miles for the period of 14 March to 1 April, making good use of their time to run or walk. Exciting awards for the Best Individual and Best Class were up for grabs too!</p><p>Through the event, Regenites were able to spend more time with their families and friends, exploring various places in Singapore on foot while clocking their runs. Together, our Regenites did an amazing job during the virtual run, and lived out the slogan by staying the course to clock a whopping total of 10,000 km!</p><p>An awards ceremony was conducted on 14 April to recognise the spirited efforts of all. These included the top 10 boys and girls for each level and the top 3 staff (male/female). We are pleased to announce that 1-Integrity, 2-Empathy, 3-Integrity, and 4-Empathy clinched the Best Class awards for their levels! Kudos too to our Taekwondo team, which has been awarded “Best CCA”!</p><p>Congratulations to all our award winners, and we hope to see all Regenites continue to stay active and healthy!</p><hr><h2><strong>Regent Around Singapore Virtual Challenge 2021</strong></h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Sports%20Events/Virtual-Run-Banner-1024x582.png"></div><p>In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Regent PE department has organized a virtual run instead of a live event for this year’s Cross Country. Thus, Regent’s Journey Around Singapore Challenge was created!</p><p>The challenge for every class is to clock 193km as a class (FYI: The total distance of Singapore’s coastline is 193km!). Students were able to compete with one another through a live leaderboard as well! Students were encouraged to stay active and fit during the pandemic and to run together with their family members as a form of family bonding.</p><p>During the two weeks of the challenge, students are to clock their distance using a distance tracking application on his smart phones. Students will then upload their distance clocked during the run and a screenshot of the route that they ran. The upload was seamless and the instructions were easy to follow! Students can keep track of the total distance that they have clocked via the live leaderboard available on the website.</p><p>At the end of the challenge, awards are given out to the top 10 male and female students of each level. Awards for best class per level and top 3 staff members were given as well. Overall, our students and staff are enjoyed their runs and explored new places at the same time. Let’s stay healthy during this period of time and we hope this challenge has motivated everyone to continue to stay active and fit!</p>
