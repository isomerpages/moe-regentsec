<p>Our graduating cohort had their Sports Fiesta (Ultimate Frisbee) tournament
on 30 June 2023 before they swing into full preparation for their national
examinations. Through this inter-class tournament, students had the opportunity
to apply the Ultimate skills that they have learnt during the PE lessons.
4-Pride was awarded the Overall Class Champion. Qaysh Matin from 4-Determination
and Yuki Khoo from 4-Empathy both won the Best Sportsmanship awards.</p>

<p>When Your Legs Get Tired, Run With Your Heart</p>
<p>After a three-year hiatus, our annual Cross-Country Run made a triumphant
return this morning! The early morning rain threatened to put a stop to
the race even before it started but our fears were short-lived as the skies
cleared and the rays of golden sunlight broke through the clouds. Wave
after wave of eager runners made their way from the school hall, across
the field and to the starting line at the Pang Sua Park Connector. There
was an air of anticipation as the runners inched closer and closer to the
starting line, awaiting the blast of the airhorn that signaled the start
of the race…and off they went!</p>
<p>The 3.5km route took the runners through different terrain, from gravel,
to dirt and onto the Pang Sua Park Connector. While the competitive runners
jostled and challenged for the top positions in their respective categories,
the fun-runners walked and jogged alongside their friends, teachers and
even our Principal and Vice-Principals! It was a rare opportunity for everyone
to be outdoors and enjoying the fresh morning air for a change!</p>
<p>For some of us, it was about creating memories with friends and classmates;
for others, it was about pushing themselves to their physical limits and
achieving their personal bests. Regardless of our motivation, we are all
runners and winners today…if you run, you are already a winner. It does
not matter how fast you are or how long you run. It does not matter if
today is your first attempt at running 3.5km or if you have been running
much longer distances. The glory is not in finishing the race but in having
the courage to start.</p>
<p>If there is one takeaway from today, it is ‘When your legs get tired,
run with your heart’!</p>

<h2><strong>Virtual Run 2022</strong></h2>
<h4><em>“When your legs get tired, run with your heart.”</em></h4>
<p>This was the slogan for the highly anticipated Regent Virtual Run 2022.
Similar to last year’s edition, our staff and students worked hard to clock
their miles for the period of 14 March to 1 April, making good use of their
time to run or walk. Exciting awards for the Best Individual and Best Class
were up for grabs too!</p>
<p>Through the event, Regenites were able to spend more time with their families
and friends, exploring various places in Singapore on foot while clocking
their runs. Together, our Regenites did an amazing job during the virtual
run, and lived out the slogan by staying the course to clock a whopping
total of 10,000 km!</p>
<p>An awards ceremony was conducted on 14 April to recognise the spirited
efforts of all. These included the top 10 boys and girls for each level
and the top 3 staff (male/female). We are pleased to announce that 1-Integrity,
2-Empathy, 3-Integrity, and 4-Empathy clinched the Best Class awards for
their levels! Kudos too to our Taekwondo team, which has been awarded “Best
CCA”!</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our award winners, and we hope to see all Regenites
continue to stay active and healthy!</p>

<p>In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Regent PE department has organized a
virtual run instead of a live event for this year’s Cross Country. Thus,
Regent’s Journey Around Singapore Challenge was created!</p>
<p>The challenge for every class is to clock 193km as a class (FYI: The total
distance of Singapore’s coastline is 193km!). Students were able to compete
with one another through a live leaderboard as well! Students were encouraged
to stay active and fit during the pandemic and to run together with their
family members as a form of family bonding.</p>
<p>During the two weeks of the challenge, students are to clock their distance
using a distance tracking application on his smart phones. Students will
then upload their distance clocked during the run and a screenshot of the
route that they ran. The upload was seamless and the instructions were
easy to follow! Students can keep track of the total distance that they
have clocked via the live leaderboard available on the website.</p>
<p>At the end of the challenge, awards are given out to the top 10 male and
female students of each level. Awards for best class per level and top
3 staff members were given as well. Overall, our students and staff are
enjoyed their runs and explored new places at the same time. Let’s stay
healthy during this period of time and we hope this challenge has motivated
everyone to continue to stay active and fit!</p>
