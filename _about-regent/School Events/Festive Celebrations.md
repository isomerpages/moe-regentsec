### **Chinese New Year Celebrations**

 The all year-round Chinese New Year concert which was held in January, gave the students exposure to the Chinese festivities. Chinese New Year celebration offers a showcase to how Chinese New Year is being celebrated by the Chinese people here in Singapore. For the first segment of the concert, the principal kick-start the Chinese New Year concert by painting a Chinese letter on the piece of paper with a Chinese paintbrush. This was followed by a short speech.

 For the next segment of the concert, the emcee hosted a short quiz of about Chinese New Year. Each level was given an opportunity for a student to represent their level in the short quiz. After which it was time for the well-known lion dance. The backstage crew had already prepared the plate which was filled with oranges, cabbage, and some other vegetables with fruits. We also have a mascot holding onto a gold pot that he then threw chocolate gold coins out of it. As the lion dance crew made their way to the stage, the mascot went around the hall to throw chocolate gold coins to students and teachers. At the same time, the lions have made it on the stage. A few moments later, strips of the oranges as well as the cabbages were being thrown in the air by the lion mascots. Screams of joy and laughter were being heard in each corner of the hall.

After Lion Dance troupe exited from the Hall, students were treated with exciting performance of Sichuan “Facemask Changing”. The performer dressed with traditional Chinese opera costume. Every time, he turned, the mask on his face changed into new mask. After the “Facemask Changing” performance, our school Movement and Dance Group put up a Chinese Dance performance for the whole shool. In the last segment, we had the iconic sing-along segment which Regent would always have in the last segment.

### **Hari Raya Celebrations**

Hari Raya Aidilfitri this year was celebrated differently, due to the global pandemic caused by the Covid-19 virus. Muslims all over the world, have had to celebrate the day that marked the end of the month-long fasting of Ramadan in a novel way.

Although, it has been a tradition whereby this day started with a trip to the mosque early in the morning when special prayers are performed as an expression of gratitude for being able to fast for the whole month. Traditionally, this is followed by a grand meal with family members to enjoy the delicious traditional dishes such as ‘rendang’, ‘ketupat ‘and not forgetting, the variety of cookies of different flavours.

Unfortunately, Hari Raya this year was celebrated in an unexpected way that left a lasting memory to those that went through it. As they say, this Hari Raya shall be remembered in the history books.

Muslims here, instead of visiting their loved ones, have had to do virtual visits instead which comprised of video conferencing apps such as G.Meet and Zoom. Of course this means all staffs and students of Regent Secondary School have to abide by such rulings due to the safety measures in place. A new normal emerged because instead of asking for forgiveness face- to- face, everyone wished everyone else LIVE but virtually. Everyone tried to cheer everyone else up by giving lots of words of wisdoms but deep down, a tinge of sadness emerged because the act of physical salaam i.e. touching of one hand to the other in a symbol of respect, was missing. Nevertheless, the pandemic does not stop staff and students of Regent Secondary School to build beautiful bonds with their loved ones on the first day of Hari Raya.
