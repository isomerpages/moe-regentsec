## **Chinese New Year 2023**

Today, Regent ushered in the Lunar New Year of the Rabbit with a hybrid mode of celebrations!

The day started off with students learning more about the significance of the Lunar New Year and its traditions through a virtual Bingo game in class. The lively and festive atmosphere was further heightened with a concert in the School Hall. There was a show-stopping lion dance performance as well as items put up by our very own Regent Modern Dance Group and the Regent Revolution Show Choir. Students also got to learn about the intriguing art of face-changing, and there was much fun and laughter to be had with the return of our annual crowd favourite—the God of Fortune!

The celebrations concluded with a finale comprising Chinese New Year-themed videos, and we all sang a medley of CNY songs with much gusto.Here’s wishing all our readers and Regenites a bountiful and joyous New Year and may we all leap to new heights!

## **Hari Raya Celebrations 2022**

It has been two years our last Hari Raya mass celebrations in school and this year we are grateful for the chance to come together once more to enjoy the festivities celebrated by our Muslim teachers and peers. Nur ‘iliyin binte Joemarino from 4-Respect shares more about her experience of this special event.

“Hari Raya is a joyous celebration where Muslims all over the world celebrate the end of fasting during the month of Ramadhan. During the celebration in school this year, Muslim students from various levels collaborated with one another and put up a wonderful performance. This year’s performance was fascinating as it was a two in one celebration consisting of pre-recorded video segments as well as live segments. From the video, I learnt more about how Hari Raya Puasa is being celebrated and the different types of cuisines as well as traditional dishes eaten during Hari Raya Puasa. I also finally understand the meaning of Maaf Zahir dan Batin from the explanations given during the quiz segment.

I love the performances because of the different elements of music compiled together back from 1950s to 2000s. It brought back memories for me as we reminisced the traditional Hari Raya songs I grew up listening to. Not only that, I contributed by being part of the ‘Regent Pop Band’ as one of the singers alongside with my band mates. We had covered the song Selamat Hari Raya by Saloma. It was a fruitful experience, singing together and rehearsing our parts to produce the whole Regent Pop Band music video. Even our Malay ‘cikgus’ serenaded us with a song or two!

Personally, I am grateful because it was the first time in two years that all Regenites were able to gather in the school hall once again. It touched my heart as we could finally come together to celebrate Hari Raya as a school once again. I look forward to more celebrations and performances put together for our Regenites in the years to come. Selamat Hari Raya everyone!”
