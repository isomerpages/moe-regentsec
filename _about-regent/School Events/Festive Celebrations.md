<h2><strong>Hari Raya Celebration 2024</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;It was a momentous occasion at Regent Secondary School as the vibrant
spirit of Hari Raya Aidilfitri filled the air. With the departure of the
holy month of Ramadhan, we joyously welcomed Syawal, a time for celebration,
gratitude, and humility.</p>
<p>At Regent Secondary School, we embrace diversity and foster cultural understanding
among our students. The Hari Raya Programme 2024 underscored our commitment
to promoting these cultural cohesion and social harmony.</p>
<p>As part of this year's festivities, Regenites from all levels took part
in an exhilarating Inter-class Challenge titled ‚ÄúOne Day During Hari Raya‚Äù
on the morning of April 16. The challenge tasked students with showcasing
the themes of ‚ÄòHappiness and Gratitude‚Äô through their creations using plasticine.
In under thirty minutes, students had to craft figurines depicting traditional
costumes, delicacies, and moments of family bonding typically observed
during Hari Raya.</p>
<p>It was truly inspiring to witness the creativity and teamwork displayed
by our students as they raced against the clock to mold their plasticine
masterpieces. The resulting creations were a testament to the spirit of
unity and collaboration that thrives within our school community.</p>
<p>With each figurine and scene, our Regenites showcased not only their artistic
talents but also their appreciation for the rich cultural heritage of Hari
Raya Aidilfitri. Through this event, we reaffirm our commitment to fostering
a school environment where diversity is celebrated, and all students feel
a sense of belonging.</p>

<h2><strong>Celebration@Regent</strong></h2>
<h4>Sustainable Celebrations: Embracing Chinese New Year with Environmental Consciousness</h4>
<p>This Chinese New Year, our classrooms at Regent, are radiating with creativity
and eco-consciousness as we adorn them with decorations crafted from recycled
materials. Students have transformed everyday items like newspapers and
plastic bottles, and recycled old Hong Bao packets, into vibrant lanterns
and fiery dragons, skilled calligraphy, and intricate paper-cuttings, infusing
our learning spaces with the spirit of tradition and sustainability. By
re-purposing materials that would otherwise end up in landfills, we're
not only reducing waste but also embodying the values of resourcefulness
and environmental stewardship. These creative decorations that line our
corridors were a result of an Inter-class CNY Classroom Corridor Walls
Decorations Competition. The decorations were judged on three areas, namely
creativity, recycling efforts and teamwork. These eco-friendly decorations
serve as a reminder of our commitment to honoring tradition while caring
for the planet. As we celebrate the Year of the Dragon, let's continue
to find innovative ways to incorporate sustainability into our festivities
and inspire others to join us in creating a greener, more sustainable future.
Happy New Year!</p>

<h3><strong>Chinese New Year 2023</strong></h3>
<p>Today, Regent ushered in the Lunar New Year of the Rabbit with a hybrid
mode of celebrations!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The day started off with students learning more about the significance
of the Lunar New Year and its traditions through a virtual Bingo game in
class. The lively and festive atmosphere was further heightened with a
concert in the School Hall. There was a show-stopping lion dance performance
as well as items put up by our very own Regent Modern Dance Group and the
Regent Revolution Show Choir. Students also got to learn about the intriguing
art of face-changing, and there was much fun and laughter to be had with
the return of our annual crowd favourite‚Äîthe God of Fortune!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The celebrations concluded with a finale comprising Chinese New Year-themed
videos, and we all sang a medley of CNY songs with much gusto. Here‚Äôs wishing
all our readers and Regenites a bountiful and joyous New Year and may we
all leap to new heights!</p>

<h3><strong>Hari Raya Celebrations 2023</strong></h3>
<p>We bade farewell to the holy month of Ramadan and ushered in the month
of Syawal with our Hari Raya Aidilfitri Concert on 18 April 2023.</p>
<p>Themed ‚ÄúCahaya Aidilfitri‚Äù (Light of Aidilfitri), the Concert saw our
student talents putting up a series of performances to showcase the rich
cultural and religious traditions of the Malay-Muslim community in Singapore.
There were dance performances by our Malay Language students as well as
a show-stopping Silat display; our English Drama club also performed a
sketch to illustrate the significance that the holy month holds for Muslims
across the world. In keeping with the festivities, Regenites were also
treated to a musical performance by the Regent Pop Band, who performed
a selection of Raya songs old and new.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was heartening to see all students and staff coming together
as one to celebrate Eid with joy and thanksgiving!</p>
