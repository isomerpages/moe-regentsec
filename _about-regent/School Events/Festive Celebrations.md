<h2><strong>Hari Raya Concert</strong></h2>
<h4>Hari Raya Concert 2025: A Celebration of Culture, Unity and Joy</h4>
<p>The harmonious melodies of Zapin, the magical chimes of Gamelan, the joyous
drumbeats, and the uplifting voices of singers intertwined gracefully to
illuminate vibrant performances in Malay dance, Pencak Silat, Wayang Kulit,
and a lively pop band sing-along session.</p>
<p>For the first time, the concert featured Wayang Kulit‚Äîa traditional shadow
puppet presentation that brought stories to life while educating the audience
about Hari Raya Aidilfitri. This unique addition sparked curiosity among
Regenites, who eagerly engaged in an interactive quiz about the festival‚Äôs
significance. This was further enriched by the elegance of the Tarian Zapin
Aidilfitri and the dynamic, warrior-like movements of the Pencak Silat
performers, drawing both awe and admiration from the audience.</p>
