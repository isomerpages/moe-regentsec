<h4>Sustainable Celebrations: Embracing Chinese New Year with Environmental Consciousness</h4>
<p>This Chinese New Year, our classrooms at Regent, are radiating with creativity
and eco-consciousness as we adorn them with decorations crafted from recycled
materials. Students have transformed everyday items like newspapers and
plastic bottles, and recycled old Hong Bao packets, into vibrant lanterns
and fiery dragons, skilled calligraphy, and intricate paper-cuttings, infusing
our learning spaces with the spirit of tradition and sustainability. By
re-purposing materials that would otherwise end up in landfills, we're
not only reducing waste but also embodying the values of resourcefulness
and environmental stewardship. These creative decorations that line our
corridors were a result of an Inter-class CNY Classroom Corridor Walls
Decorations Competition. The decorations were judged on three areas, namely
creativity, recycling efforts and teamwork. These eco-friendly decorations
serve as a reminder of our commitment to honoring tradition while caring
for the planet. As we celebrate the Year of the Dragon, let's continue
to find innovative ways to incorporate sustainability into our festivities
and inspire others to join us in creating a greener, more sustainable future.
Happy New Year!</p>

<h2><strong>Chinese New Year 2023</strong></h2>
<p>Today, Regent ushered in the Lunar New Year of the Rabbit with a hybrid
mode of celebrations!</p>
<p>The day started off with students learning more about the significance
of the Lunar New Year and its traditions through a virtual Bingo game in
class. The lively and festive atmosphere was further heightened with a
concert in the School Hall. There was a show-stopping lion dance performance
as well as items put up by our very own Regent Modern Dance Group and the
Regent Revolution Show Choir. Students also got to learn about the intriguing
art of face-changing, and there was much fun and laughter to be had with
the return of our annual crowd favourite—the God of Fortune!</p>
<p>The celebrations concluded with a finale comprising Chinese New Year-themed
videos, and we all sang a medley of CNY songs with much gusto.Here’s wishing
all our readers and Regenites a bountiful and joyous New Year and may we
all leap to new heights!</p>

<h2><strong>Hari Raya Celebrations 2023</strong></h2>
<p>We bade farewell to the holy month of Ramadan and ushered in the month
of Syawal with our Hari Raya Aidilfitri Concert on 18 April 2023.</p>
<p>Themed “Cahaya Aidilfitri” (Light of Aidilfitri), the Concert saw our
student talents putting up a series of performances to showcase the rich
cultural and religious traditions of the Malay-Muslim community in Singapore.
There were dance performances by our Malay Language students as well as
a show-stopping Silat display; our English Drama club also performed a
sketch to illustrate the significance that the holy month holds for Muslims
across the world. In keeping with the festivities, Regenites were also
treated to a musical performance by the Regent Pop Band, who performed
a selection of Raya songs old and new.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was heartening to see all students and staff coming together
as one to celebrate Eid with joy and thanksgiving!</p>
