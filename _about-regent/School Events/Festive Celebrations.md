### **Chinese New Year Celebrations**

 The all year-round Chinese New Year concert which was held in January, gave the students exposure to the Chinese festivities. Chinese New Year celebration offers a showcase to how Chinese New Year is being celebrated by the Chinese people here in Singapore. For the first segment of the concert, the principal kick-start the Chinese New Year concert by painting a Chinese letter on the piece of paper with a Chinese paintbrush. This was followed by a short speech.

 For the next segment of the concert, the emcee hosted a short quiz of about Chinese New Year. Each level was given an opportunity for a student to represent their level in the short quiz. After which it was time for the well-known lion dance. The backstage crew had already prepared the plate which was filled with oranges, cabbage, and some other vegetables with fruits. We also have a mascot holding onto a gold pot that he then threw chocolate gold coins out of it. As the lion dance crew made their way to the stage, the mascot went around the hall to throw chocolate gold coins to students and teachers. At the same time, the lions have made it on the stage. A few moments later, strips of the oranges as well as the cabbages were being thrown in the air by the lion mascots. Screams of joy and laughter were being heard in each corner of the hall.

After Lion Dance troupe exited from the Hall, students were treated with exciting performance of Sichuan “Facemask Changing”. The performer dressed with traditional Chinese opera costume. Every time, he turned, the mask on his face changed into new mask. After the “Facemask Changing” performance, our school Movement and Dance Group put up a Chinese Dance performance for the whole shool. In the last segment, we had the iconic sing-along segment which Regent would always have in the last segment.
