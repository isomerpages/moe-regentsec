### **23rd Elementz Fair – Gold Award**

Have you ever wondered how planes fly? Or even thought about the best household chemicals that help to remove ink stains on your school uniform? Let our Elementz teams tell you how!

Since November 2021, our two teams of Secondary Four students have put in their heart and hands preparing for the 23rd Elementz Fair held by ASRJC. They spent countless hours in the school laboratory conducting their experiments, and even self-built their own plane launcher from scratch!

After months of dedication and hard work, we are immensely proud to announce that one of our teams managed to clinch the coveted Gold award! The other team put in their best effort, and received a certificate of commendation. Well done, Team Regent!

Weng Hin shared that the project had challenged him to step out of his comfort zone in speaking up to express his views. “Being a naturally introverted person, it was, for me, quite socially awkward to speak up and express my views. However, during this project, I have learnt to step out of my comfort zone to challenge myself to be more outspoken and how to properly transfer my thoughts into speech for my groupmates to understand, which has helped boost my communication skills further.”

Team member Jacintha Lin shared that it was challenging for her to understand the Physics concepts behind the project as a Biology student at first. However, through her willingness to learn and with the help of her group members, she successfully managed to present the theoretical background of flight to the panel of judges. Through the project, she also become more open to feedback from others, and became more confident in her communication and presentation skills.

We are proud to announce that Regent Secondary School has achieved the Yellow Flame Award at the School Green Awards 2021!

Guided by our mission to equip all students and staff to become responsible advocates of the environment, Regent’s environmental programmes seek to promote good environmental habits and involve the wider community in environmental efforts.

This year, our students from the Environmental Sciences Club led the school-wide effort to turn used items into new products, including mask holders, tote bags, and coin banks. Ongoing recycling and energy-saving efforts have also helped us become a greener school. Through this, we have effected a positive environmental impact in our school and community. Let’s continue to do our part for the environment!

### **Accolades from Regent Red Cross Youth**

Our Regent Red Cross Youth cadets recently participated in two inter-school competitions organised by the Singapore Red Cross Youth.

Two of our Secondary Three cadets participated in the Ambassadors of Blood Competition, where they were given the opportunity to hone their oratorical skills whilst raising awareness about blood donation in Singapore. We are pleased to announce that our cadets, Elise and Isaiah, won a Silver and a Bronze award respectively!

Our Disaster Risk Reduction Championship team also clinched a Silver award for their interactive, game-based project on dengue. They explored ways to educate their juniors about dengue prevention measures, and demonstrated creativity in adapting the material for online teaching in these times. One of our cadets, Lim Yi Quan, shared that the experience has taught him more about lesson delivery, and how tools such as Kahoot can be used to engage their peers who may be hesitant to ask questions in-person or online. The project has also been valuable in developing cadets’ leadership competencies as confident CCA leaders and mentors to their juniors.

Congratulations and well done to our Red Cross Youth cadets!
