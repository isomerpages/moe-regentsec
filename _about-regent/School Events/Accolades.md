<p>Semester 1 was an exciting one for Regent Red Cross Youth! With physical
events back in full swing this year, our cadets had the opportunity to
put their skills to the test at various competitions organised by the Singapore
Red Cross.</p>
<p>February saw our cadets participating in the Ambassadors of Blood Donation
Competition (ABC) and Disaster Risk Reduction Championships (DRRC). Cadet
Ihsan Yusri (3-Respect) attained the Gold Award for his engaging ABC presentation,
and our DRRC team—comprising Jonas Sim (3-Integrity), Javier Koh (3-Respect),
Seah Yao Yu and Hasan Hanafi (3-Determination)—was awarded Bronze for their
interactive showcase on fire safety at home.</p>

<h2><strong>NPCC Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA) – GOLD</strong></h2>
<p>We are pleased to announce that our National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC)
unit has attained the Unit Overall Proficiency Award (Distinction) for
the year 2022!</p>
<p>The UOPA is awarded to school units each year to promote excellence and
proficiency at all levels, and the Distinction award is the highest possible
honour a unit may attain. Thanks to the work of its cadets, teachers, and
volunteer officers, Regent’s NPCC unit has been able to uphold its exceptional
track record of robust and spirited training sessions.</p>
<p>2022 saw NPCC cadets participating in various modules and competitions,
and the loosening of restrictions also allowed for the resumption of out-of-school
activities such as the Dragon Boating Sport Enrichment Programme, Air Pistol
Course, and visits to the Singapore Discovery Centre. This year, our cadets
can look forward to taking part in a slew of activities that were shelved
during the pandemic! These include Camp Resilience at Pulau Ubin and an
exciting learning journey to the K-9 unit.</p>
<p>We are grateful for the support of all our stakeholders and may Regent
continue to blaze forth to glory!</p>

<h2><strong>23rd&nbsp;Elementz Fair – Gold Award</strong></h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered how planes fly? Or even thought about the best
household chemicals that help to remove ink stains on your school uniform?
Let our Elementz teams tell you how!</p>
<p>Since November 2021, our two teams of Secondary Four students have put
in their heart and hands preparing for the 23rd Elementz Fair held by ASRJC.
They spent countless hours in the school laboratory conducting their experiments,
and even self-built their own plane launcher from scratch!</p>
<p>After months of dedication and hard work, we are immensely proud to announce
that one of our teams managed to clinch the coveted Gold award! The other
team put in their best effort, and received a certificate of commendation.
Well done, Team Regent!</p>
<p>Weng Hin shared that the project had challenged him to step out of his
comfort zone in speaking up to express his views. “Being a naturally introverted
person, it was, for me, quite socially awkward to speak up and express
my views. However, during this project, I have learnt to step out of my
comfort zone to challenge myself to be more outspoken and how to properly
transfer my thoughts into speech for my groupmates to understand, which
has helped boost my communication skills further.”</p>
<p>Team member Jacintha Lin shared that it was challenging for her to understand
the Physics concepts behind the project as a Biology student at first.
However, through her willingness to learn and with the help of her group
members, she successfully managed to present the theoretical background
of flight to the panel of judges. Through the project, she also become
more open to feedback from others, and became more confident in her communication
and presentation skills.</p>

<p>This year, our students from the Environmental Sciences Club led the school-wide
effort to turn used items into new products, including mask holders, tote
bags, and coin banks. Ongoing recycling and energy-saving efforts have
also helped us become a greener school. Through this, we have effected
a positive environmental impact in our school and community. Let’s continue
to do our part for the environment!</p>
