Or even thought about the best household chemicals that help to remove ink stains on your school uniform? Let our Elementz teams tell you how!</p><p>Since November 2021, our two teams of Secondary Four students have put in their heart and hands preparing for the 23rd Elementz Fair held by ASRJC. They spent countless hours in the school laboratory conducting their experiments, and even self-built their own plane launcher from scratch!</p><p>After months of dedication and hard work, we are immensely proud to announce that one of our teams managed to clinch the coveted Gold award! The other team put in their best effort, and received a certificate of commendation. Well done, Team Regent!</p><p>Weng Hin shared that the project had challenged him to step out of his comfort zone in speaking up to express his views. “Being a naturally introverted person, it was, for me, quite socially awkward to speak up and express my views. However, during this project, I have learnt to step out of my comfort zone to challenge myself to be more outspoken and how to properly transfer my thoughts into speech for my groupmates to understand, which has helped boost my communication skills further.”</p><p>Team member Jacintha Lin shared that it was challenging for her to understand the Physics concepts behind the project as a Biology student at first. However, through her willingness to learn and with the help of her group members, she successfully managed to present the theoretical background of flight to the panel of judges. Through the project, she also become more open to feedback from others, and became more confident in her communication and presentation skills.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Accolades/23rdElementzFair-1.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Accolades/23rdElementzFair-2.jpg"></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Accolades/23rdElementzFair-3.jpg"></div><hr><h2><strong>School Green Awards 2021</strong></h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Accolades/SchGreenAwards2021-1.jpeg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/School%20Events/Accolades/SchGreenAwards2021-2.jpeg"></div><p>We are proud to announce that Regent Secondary School has achieved the Yellow Flame Award at the School Green Awards 2021!</p><p>Guided by our mission to equip all students and staff to become responsible advocates of the environment, Regent’s environmental programmes seek to promote good environmental habits and involve the wider community in environmental efforts.
