<h2><strong>A Flow of Learning: Secondary 1 Learning Journey to Marina Barrage</strong></h2>
<p>On 10 April 2025, our Secondary 1 students set off on an exciting learning
journey to Marina Barrage, building on classroom lessons about water and
conservation. This multidisciplinary trip seamlessly wove together concepts
from English, Mathematics, Science, and Geography in a hands-on, real-world
setting.</p>

<p>Students witnessed a live demonstration of the Marina Barrage dam in action,
gaining insights into how it helps regulate water levels and prevents flooding.
This was an eye-opening example of Singapore‚Äôs innovative water management
strategies. A guided tour of the Sustainable Singapore Gallery followed,
where students explored interactive exhibits on green living, clean energy,
and water recycling, deepening their appreciation for our nation‚Äôs sustainability
efforts.</p>
<p>Hands-on learning continued as students engaged in a fun recycling game
and tried their hand at upcycling. They turned old t-shirts into reusable
tote bags, a creative activity that reinforced their understanding of environmental
responsibility.</p>
<p>For many, it was both an educational and meaningful experience. Chua Xuan
Wei Eason from 1 Pride shared, ‚ÄúI learnt how to upcycle old clothes into
a tote bag. I also thoroughly enjoyed the water show as they showed how
the Marina Barrage dam works!‚Äù</p>
<p>It was truly a memorable day of learning, exploration and reflection!</p>

<h2><strong>Secondary 1 Science Integrative Activity</strong></h2>
<h4>From Muddy Water to Bright Ideas: Secondary 1 Science in Action</h4>
<p>The Secondary One Science Integrative Activity brought science to life
as students took on a real-world challenge‚Äîcleaning muddy water using self-built
water purification devices. In a country like Singapore, where freshwater
is scarce and clean water relies on desalination and imports, this hands-on
experience was both relevant and meaningful.</p>
<p>Working in groups, students researched how filtration works in everyday
contexts, learning about materials like sand, gravel, and activated carbon.
With these insights, they designed and built their own water purification
prototypes using provided materials. Their goal was to transform murky
water into clean water by applying scientific principles such as filtration
and adsorption.</p>

<p>Armed with their new Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), students collaborated
online to refine their ideas and compile their findings. This digital teamwork
not only deepened their understanding but also fostered 21st-century skills
like collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>The highlight came when students tested their creations by filtering muddy
water and measuring turbidity‚Äîthe water‚Äôs clarity‚Äîusing a turbidity disc.
Through this, they evaluated their prototypes and discussed improvements,
turning trial and error into valuable lessons.</p>

<p>Each group then presented their findings, walking their peers through
the design process, results, and reflections. ‚ÄúI think it was interesting
as we could build our own filtration devices and try to see if it works,‚Äù
said Liang Shan Ning, capturing the excitement of learning by doing.</p>
<p>Beyond just science, this project empowered students to think critically,
work creatively, and tackle real-world problems‚Äîkey steps in shaping confident,
innovative learners ready for the future.</p>

<h2><strong>Gardens By the Bay: Race to Sustainability</strong></h2>
<p>Our Secondary 2 students recently embarked on an engaging and educational
Post-Exam Learning Journey to Gardens by the Bay. Stepping beyond the classroom,
they participated in the <em>Race to Sustainability</em> ‚Äî an annual inter-school
competition that challenges students to explore the wonders of Gardens
by the Bay by solving puzzles and answering questions. This immersive experience
provided students with a unique opportunity to learn about Singapore‚Äôs
sustainable practices and discover the rich biodiversity of plants and
animals within the Gardens.</p>

</div>
<p>Adding an exciting twist to their journey, the Math and Mother Tongue
departments collaborated to create the <em>Regent Bilingual Math Quest</em>.
This activity encouraged students to apply their mensuration skills to
complete measurement tasks and craft captions in their respective Mother
Tongue languages to describe the captivating attractions they encountered.</p>

<p>As they explored the breathtaking Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, students
engaged in hands-on learning, teamwork, and developed a deeper appreciation
for environmental sustainability. This memorable experience not only made
learning enjoyable but also helped bridge classroom knowledge with real-world
applications.</p>

<h2><strong>23rd&nbsp;Elementz Fair ‚Äì Gold Award</strong></h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered how planes fly? Or even thought about the best
household chemicals that help to remove ink stains on your school uniform?
Let our Elementz teams tell you how!</p>
<p>Since November 2021, our two teams of Secondary Four students have put
in their heart and hands preparing for the 23rd Elementz Fair held by ASRJC.
They spent countless hours in the school laboratory conducting their experiments,
and even self-built their own plane launcher from scratch!</p>
<p>After months of dedication and hard work, we are immensely proud to announce
that one of our teams managed to clinch the coveted Gold award! The other
team put in their best effort, and received a certificate of commendation.
Well done, Team Regent!</p>
<p>Weng Hin shared that the project had challenged him to step out of his
comfort zone in speaking up to express his views. ‚ÄúBeing a naturally introverted
person, it was, for me, quite socially awkward to speak up and express
my views. However, during this project, I have learnt to step out of my
comfort zone to challenge myself to be more outspoken and how to properly
transfer my thoughts into speech for my groupmates to understand, which
has helped boost my communication skills further.‚Äù</p>
<p>Team member Jacintha Lin shared that it was challenging for her to understand
the Physics concepts behind the project as a Biology student at first.
However, through her willingness to learn and with the help of her group
members, she successfully managed to present the theoretical background
of flight to the panel of judges. Through the project, she also become
more open to feedback from others, and became more confident in her communication
and presentation skills.</p>
