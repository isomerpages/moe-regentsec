<h2><strong>Gardens By the Bay: Race to Sustainability</strong></h2>
<p>Our Secondary 2 students recently embarked on an engaging and educational
Post-Exam Learning Journey to Gardens by the Bay. Stepping beyond the classroom,
they participated in the <em>Race to Sustainability</em> — an annual inter-school
competition that challenges students to explore the wonders of Gardens
by the Bay by solving puzzles and answering questions. This immersive experience
provided students with a unique opportunity to learn about Singapore’s
sustainable practices and discover the rich biodiversity of plants and
animals within the Gardens.</p>

<p>Adding an exciting twist to their journey, the Math and Mother Tongue
departments collaborated to create the <em>Regent Bilingual Math Quest</em>.
This activity encouraged students to apply their mensuration skills to
complete measurement tasks and craft captions in their respective Mother
Tongue languages to describe the captivating attractions they encountered.</p>

<p>As they explored the breathtaking Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, students
engaged in hands-on learning, teamwork, and developed a deeper appreciation
for environmental sustainability. This memorable experience not only made
learning enjoyable but also helped bridge classroom knowledge with real-world
applications.</p>

<h2><strong>23rd&nbsp;Elementz Fair – Gold Award</strong></h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered how planes fly? Or even thought about the best
household chemicals that help to remove ink stains on your school uniform?
Let our Elementz teams tell you how!</p>
<p>Since November 2021, our two teams of Secondary Four students have put
in their heart and hands preparing for the 23rd Elementz Fair held by ASRJC.
They spent countless hours in the school laboratory conducting their experiments,
and even self-built their own plane launcher from scratch!</p>
<p>After months of dedication and hard work, we are immensely proud to announce
that one of our teams managed to clinch the coveted Gold award! The other
team put in their best effort, and received a certificate of commendation.
Well done, Team Regent!</p>
<p>Weng Hin shared that the project had challenged him to step out of his
comfort zone in speaking up to express his views. “Being a naturally introverted
person, it was, for me, quite socially awkward to speak up and express
my views. However, during this project, I have learnt to step out of my
comfort zone to challenge myself to be more outspoken and how to properly
transfer my thoughts into speech for my groupmates to understand, which
has helped boost my communication skills further.”</p>
<p>Team member Jacintha Lin shared that it was challenging for her to understand
the Physics concepts behind the project as a Biology student at first.
However, through her willingness to learn and with the help of her group
members, she successfully managed to present the theoretical background
of flight to the panel of judges. Through the project, she also become
more open to feedback from others, and became more confident in her communication
and presentation skills.</p>
