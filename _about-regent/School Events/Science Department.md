<h2><strong>A Flow of Learning: Secondary 1 Learning Journey to Marina Barrage</strong></h2>
<p>On 10 April 2025, our Secondary 1 students set off on an exciting learning
journey to Marina Barrage, building on classroom lessons about water and
conservation. This multidisciplinary trip seamlessly wove together concepts
from English, Mathematics, Science, and Geography in a hands-on, real-world
setting.</p>

<p>Students witnessed a live demonstration of the Marina Barrage dam in action,
gaining insights into how it helps regulate water levels and prevents flooding.
This was an eye-opening example of Singapore’s innovative water management
strategies. A guided tour of the Sustainable Singapore Gallery followed,
where students explored interactive exhibits on green living, clean energy,
and water recycling, deepening their appreciation for our nation’s sustainability
efforts.</p>
<p>Hands-on learning continued as students engaged in a fun recycling game
and tried their hand at upcycling. They turned old t-shirts into reusable
tote bags, a creative activity that reinforced their understanding of environmental
responsibility.</p>
<p>For many, it was both an educational and meaningful experience. Chua Xuan
Wei Eason from 1 Pride shared, “I learnt how to upcycle old clothes into
a tote bag. I also thoroughly enjoyed the water show as they showed how
the Marina Barrage dam works!”</p>
<p>It was truly a memorable day of learning, exploration and reflection!</p>

<h2><strong>Secondary 1 Science Integrative Activity</strong></h2>
<h4>From Muddy Water to Bright Ideas: Secondary 1 Science in Action</h4>
<p>The Secondary One Science Integrative Activity brought science to life
as students took on a real-world challenge—cleaning muddy water using self-built
water purification devices. In a country like Singapore, where freshwater
is scarce and clean water relies on desalination and imports, this hands-on
experience was both relevant and meaningful.</p>
<p>Working in groups, students researched how filtration works in everyday
contexts, learning about materials like sand, gravel, and activated carbon.
With these insights, they designed and built their own water purification
prototypes using provided materials. Their goal was to transform murky
water into clean water by applying scientific principles such as filtration
and adsorption.</p>

<p>Armed with their new Personal Learning Devices (PLDs), students collaborated
online to refine their ideas and compile their findings. This digital teamwork
not only deepened their understanding but also fostered 21st-century skills
like collaboration and communication.</p>
<p>The highlight came when students tested their creations by filtering muddy
water and measuring turbidity—the water’s clarity—using a turbidity disc.
Through this, they evaluated their prototypes and discussed improvements,
turning trial and error into valuable lessons.</p>

<p>Each group then presented their findings, walking their peers through
the design process, results, and reflections. “I think it was interesting
as we could build our own filtration devices and try to see if it works,”
said Liang Shan Ning, capturing the excitement of learning by doing.</p>
<p>Beyond just science, this project empowered students to think critically,
work creatively, and tackle real-world problems—key steps in shaping confident,
innovative learners ready for the future.</p>
